<WEB Ezra 1.1>  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and {put it} also in writing, saying,
<WEB Ezra 1.2>  Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which {is} in Judah.
<WEB Ezra 1.3>  Who {is there} among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which {is} in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he {is} the God,) who {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 1.4>  And whoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the free-will-offering for the house of God that {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 1.5>  Then arose the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all {them} whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 1.6>  And all they that {were} about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all {that} was willingly offered.
<WEB Ezra 1.7>  Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;
<WEB Ezra 1.8>  Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
<WEB Ezra 1.9>  And this {is} the number of them. thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,

<WEB Ezra 1.11>  All the vessels of gold and of silver {were} five thousand and four hundred. All {these} did Sheshbazzar bring with {them of} the captivity that were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem.

<WEB Ezra 2.58>  All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, {were} three hundred ninety and two.
<WEB Ezra 2.59>  And these {were} they who went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, {and} Immer. but they could not show their fathers' house, and their seed, whether they {were} of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 2.60>  The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
<WEB Ezra 2.61>  And of the children of the priests. the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai. who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
<WEB Ezra 2.62>  These sought their register {among} those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found. therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
<WEB Ezra 2.63>  And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
<WEB Ezra 2.64>  The whole congregation together {was} forty and two thousand three hundred {and} sixty,
<WEB Ezra 2.65>  Besides their servants and their maids, of whom {there were} seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven. and {there were} among them two hundred singing-men and singing-women.
<WEB Ezra 2.66>  Their horses {were} seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
<WEB Ezra 2.67>  Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; {their} asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
<WEB Ezra 2.68>  And {some} of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which {is} at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in its place.
<WEB Ezra 2.69>  They gave after their ability to the treasure of the work sixty and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests garments.
<WEB Ezra 2.70>  So the priests, and the Levites, and {some} of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
<WEB Ezra 3.1>  And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel {were} in the cities, the people assembled themselves as one man at Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 3.2>  Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings on it as {it is} written in the law of Moses the man of God.
<WEB Ezra 3.3>  And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear {was} upon them because of the people of those countries. and they offered burnt-offerings on it to the LORD, {even} burnt-offerings morning and evening.
<WEB Ezra 3.4>  They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as {it is} written, and {offered} the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
<WEB Ezra 3.5>  And afterward {offered} the continual burnt-offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a free-will-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Ezra 3.6>  From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt-offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not {yet} laid.
<WEB Ezra 3.7>  They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and provisions, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
<WEB Ezra 3.8>  Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
<WEB Ezra 3.9>  Then stood Jeshua {with} his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God. the sons of Henadad, {with} their sons and their brethren the Levites.
<WEB Ezra 3.10>  And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 3.11>  And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because {he is} good, for his mercy {endureth} for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
<WEB Ezra 3.12>  But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, old men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy.
<WEB Ezra 3.13>  So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of the joy from the noise of the weeping of the people. for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
<WEB Ezra 4.1>  Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to the LORD God of Israel;
<WEB Ezra 4.2>  Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you. for we seek your God, as ye {do}; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, who brought us up hither.
<WEB Ezra 4.3>  But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
<WEB Ezra 4.4>  Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
<WEB Ezra 4.5>  And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
<WEB Ezra 4.6>  And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote {to him} an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 4.7>  And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions to Artaxerxes king of Persia, and the writing of the letter {was} written in the Syrian language, and interpreted in the Syrian language.
<WEB Ezra 4.8>  Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort.
<WEB Ezra 4.9>  Then {wrote} Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dianites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, {and} the Elamites,
<WEB Ezra 4.10>  And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest {that are} on this side of the river, and at such a time.
<WEB Ezra 4.11>  This {is} the copy of the letter that they sent to him, {even} to Artaxerxes the king. Thy servants the men on this side of the river, and at such a time.
<WEB Ezra 4.12>  Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came from thee to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the noxious city, and have set up its walls, and joined the foundations.
<WEB Ezra 4.13>  Be it known now to the king, that, if this city shall be built, and the walls set up {again}, {then} they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and {so} thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings.
<WEB Ezra 4.14>  Now because we have maintenance from {the king's} palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
<WEB Ezra 4.15>  That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers. so wilt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city {is} a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time. for which cause was this city destroyed.
<WEB Ezra 4.16>  We certify the king that, if this city shall be built {again}, and its walls set up, by this means thou wilt have no portion on this side of the river.
<WEB Ezra 4.17>  {Then} the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and {to} Shimshai the scribe, and {to} the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and {to} the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
<WEB Ezra 4.18>  The letter which ye sent to us hath been plainly read before me.
<WEB Ezra 4.19>  And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and {that} rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
<WEB Ezra 4.20>  There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all {countries} beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.
<WEB Ezra 4.21>  Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until {another} commandment shall be given from me.
<WEB Ezra 4.22>  Take heed now that ye fail not to do this. why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
<WEB Ezra 4.23>  Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter {was} read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
<WEB Ezra 4.24>  Then ceased the work of the house of God which {is} at Jerusalem. So it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
<WEB Ezra 5.1>  Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that {were} in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, {even} to them.
<WEB Ezra 5.2>  Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which {is} at Jerusalem. and with them {were} the prophets of God helping them.
<WEB Ezra 5.3>  At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus to them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?
<WEB Ezra 5.4>  Then said we to them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?
<WEB Ezra 5.5>  But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius. and then they returned answer by letter concerning this {matter}.
<WEB Ezra 5.6>  The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who {were} on this side of the river, sent to Darius the king.
<WEB Ezra 5.7>  They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus; To Darius the king, all peace.
<WEB Ezra 5.8>  Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work proceedeth rapidly, and prospereth in their hands.
<WEB Ezra 5.9>  Then we asked those elders, {and} said to them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to erect these walls?
<WEB Ezra 5.10>  We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that {were} the chief of them.
<WEB Ezra 5.11>  And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was erected these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.
<WEB Ezra 5.12>  But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
<WEB Ezra 5.13>  But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, {the same} king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
<WEB Ezra 5.14>  And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that {was} in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to {one}, whose name {was} Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
<WEB Ezra 5.15>  And said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that {is} in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.
<WEB Ezra 5.16>  Then came the same Sheshbazzar, {and} laid the foundation of the house of God which {is} in Jerusalem. and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and {yet} it is not finished.
<WEB Ezra 5.17>  Now therefore, if it {seemeth} good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure-house, which {is} there at Babylon, whether it is {so}, that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
<WEB Ezra 6.1>  Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
<WEB Ezra 6.2>  And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that {is} in the province of the Medes, a roll, and in it {was} a record thus written.
<WEB Ezra 6.3>  In the first year of Cyrus the king, {the same} Cyrus the king made a decree {concerning} the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations of it be strongly laid; the hight of it sixty cubits, {and} the breadth of it sixty cubits;
<WEB Ezra 6.4>  {With} three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber. and let the expenses be given out of the king's house.
<WEB Ezra 6.5>  And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which {is} at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which {is} at Jerusalem, {every one} to its place, and place {them} in the house of God.
<WEB Ezra 6.6>  Now {therefore}, Tatnai governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who {are} beyond the river, be ye far from thence.
<WEB Ezra 6.7>  Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this house of God in its place.
<WEB Ezra 6.8>  Moreover, I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God. that of the king's goods, {even} of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given to these men, that they be not hindered.
<WEB Ezra 6.9>  And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests who {are} at Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail.
<WEB Ezra 6.10>  That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
<WEB Ezra 6.11>  Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged upon it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
<WEB Ezra 6.12>  And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall attempt to alter and to destroy this house of God which {is} at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.
<WEB Ezra 6.13>  Then Tatnai governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.
<WEB Ezra 6.14>  And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished {it}, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
<WEB Ezra 6.15>  And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
<WEB Ezra 6.16>  And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,
<WEB Ezra 6.17>  And offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 6.18>  And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, who {is} at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
<WEB Ezra 6.19>  And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth {day} of the first month.
<WEB Ezra 6.20>  For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them {were} pure, and {they} killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
<WEB Ezra 6.21>  And the children of Israel, who had returned from captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,
<WEB Ezra 6.22>  And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy. for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 7.1>  Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
<WEB Ezra 7.2>  The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
<WEB Ezra 7.3>  The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
<WEB Ezra 7.4>  The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
<WEB Ezra 7.5>  The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest.
<WEB Ezra 7.6>  This Ezra went from Babylon; and he {was} a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given. and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.
<WEB Ezra 7.7>  And there went {some} of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
<WEB Ezra 7.8>  And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which {was} in the seventh year of the king.
<WEB Ezra 7.9>  For upon the first {day} of the first month he began to go from Babylon, and on the first {day} of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
<WEB Ezra 7.10>  For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do {it}, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
<WEB Ezra 7.11>  Now this {is} the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, {even} a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.
<WEB Ezra 7.12>  Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect {peace}, and at such a time.
<WEB Ezra 7.13>  I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and {of} his priests and Levites, in my realm, who are disposed of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.
<WEB Ezra 7.14>  Forasmuch as thou art sent by the king, and by his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which {is} in thy hand;
<WEB Ezra 7.15>  And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation {is} in Jerusalem,
<WEB Ezra 7.16>  And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the free-will-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 7.17>  That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 7.18>  And whatever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and gold, that do after the will of your God.
<WEB Ezra 7.19>  The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, {those} deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 7.20>  And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow {it} out of the king's treasure-house.
<WEB Ezra 7.21>  And I, {even} I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers who {are} beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,
<WEB Ezra 7.22>  To a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing {how much}.
<WEB Ezra 7.23>  Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven. for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
<WEB Ezra 7.24>  Also we certify you, that concerning any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them.
<WEB Ezra 7.25>  And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that {is} in thy hand, set magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that {are} beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know {them} not.
<WEB Ezra 7.26>  And whoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether {it be} to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
<WEB Ezra 7.27>  Blessed {be} the LORD God of our fathers, who hath put {such a thing} as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 7.28>  And hath extended mercy to me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God {was} upon me, and I assembled out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
<WEB Ezra 8.1>  These {are} now the chief of their fathers, and {this is} the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.
<WEB Ezra 8.2>  Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom. of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel. of the sons of David; Hattush.
<WEB Ezra 8.3>  Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah. and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty.
<WEB Ezra 8.4>  Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
<WEB Ezra 8.5>  Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
<WEB Ezra 8.6>  Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
<WEB Ezra 8.7>  And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
<WEB Ezra 8.8>  And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.
<WEB Ezra 8.9>  Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
<WEB Ezra 8.10>  And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty males.
<WEB Ezra 8.11>  And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males.
<WEB Ezra 8.12>  And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten males.
<WEB Ezra 8.13>  And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names {are} these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.
<WEB Ezra 8.14>  Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
<WEB Ezra 8.15>  And I assembled them at the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we abode in tents three days. and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
<WEB Ezra 8.16>  Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
<WEB Ezra 8.17>  And I sent them with commandment to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, {and} to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
<WEB Ezra 8.18>  And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
<WEB Ezra 8.19>  And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
<WEB Ezra 8.20>  Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims. all of them were expressed by name.
<WEB Ezra 8.21>  Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
<WEB Ezra 8.22>  For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way. because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God {is} upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath {is} against all them that forsake him.
<WEB Ezra 8.23>  So we fasted and besought our God for this. and he was entreated by us.
<WEB Ezra 8.24>  Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
<WEB Ezra 8.25>  And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, {even} the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Israel {there} present, had offered.
<WEB Ezra 8.26>  I even weighed to their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, {and} of gold a hundred talents;
<WEB Ezra 8.27>  Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
<WEB Ezra 8.28>  And I said to them, Ye {are} holy to the LORD; the vessels {are} holy also; and the silver and the gold {are} a free-will-offering to the LORD God of your fathers.
<WEB Ezra 8.29>  Watch ye, and keep {them}, until ye weigh {them}, before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.
<WEB Ezra 8.30>  So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring {them} to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
<WEB Ezra 8.31>  Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth {day} of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
<WEB Ezra 8.32>  And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
<WEB Ezra 8.33>  Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him {was} Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them {was} Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
<WEB Ezra 8.34>  By number {and} by weight of every one. and all the weight was written at that time.
<WEB Ezra 8.35>  {Also} the children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, offered burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats {for} a sin-offering. all {this was} a burnt-offering to the LORD.
<WEB Ezra 8.36>  And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side of the river. and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
<WEB Ezra 9.1>  Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, {doing} according to their abominations, {even} of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
<WEB Ezra 9.2>  For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons. so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of {those} lands. yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
<WEB Ezra 9.3>  And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
<WEB Ezra 9.4>  Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat confounded until the evening sacrifice.
<WEB Ezra 9.5>  And at the evening sacrifice I arose from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
<WEB Ezra 9.6>  And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God. for our iniquities are increased over {our} head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.
<WEB Ezra 9.7>  Since the days of our fathers {have} we {been} in a great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, {and} our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as {it is} this day.
<WEB Ezra 9.8>  And now for a little space grace hath been {shown} from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
<WEB Ezra 9.9>  For we {were} bond-men; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
<WEB Ezra 9.10>  And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
<WEB Ezra 9.11>  Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
<WEB Ezra 9.12>  Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever. that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave {it} for an inheritance to your children for ever.
<WEB Ezra 9.13>  And after all that hath come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities {deserve}, and hast given us {such} deliverance as this;
<WEB Ezra 9.14>  Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldst thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed {us}, so that {there should be} no remnant nor escaping?
<WEB Ezra 9.15>  O LORD God of Israel, thou {art} righteous. for we having escaped, remain yet, as {it is} this day. behold, we {are} before thee in our trespasses. for we cannot stand before thee because of this.
<WEB Ezra 10.1>  Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children. for the people wept very bitterly.
<WEB Ezra 10.2>  And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, {one} of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken foreign wives of the people of the land. yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
<WEB Ezra 10.3>  Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
<WEB Ezra 10.4>  Arise; for {this} matter {belongeth} to thee. we also {will be} with thee. be of good courage, and do {it}.
<WEB Ezra 10.5>  Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. And they swore.
<WEB Ezra 10.6>  Then Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib. and {when} he came thither, he ate no bread, nor drank water. for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
<WEB Ezra 10.7>  And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem;
<WEB Ezra 10.8>  And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
<WEB Ezra 10.9>  Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days. It {was} the ninth month, and the twentieth {day} of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of {this} matter, and for the great rain.
<WEB Ezra 10.10>  And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives to increase the trespass of Israel.
<WEB Ezra 10.11>  Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure. and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the foreign wives.
<WEB Ezra 10.12>  Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.
<WEB Ezra 10.13>  But the people {are} many, and {it is} a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand abroad, neither {is this} a work of one day or two. for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
<WEB Ezra 10.14>  Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter shall be turned from us.
<WEB Ezra 10.15>  Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this {matter}. and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
<WEB Ezra 10.16>  And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, {with} certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by {their} names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
<WEB Ezra 10.17>  And they made an end with all the men that had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
<WEB Ezra 10.18>  And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken foreign wives. {namely}, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
<WEB Ezra 10.19>  And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and {being} guilty, {they offered} a ram of the flock for their trespass.
<WEB Ezra 10.20>  And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
<WEB Ezra 10.21>  And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
<WEB Ezra 10.22>  And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
<WEB Ezra 10.23>  Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (the same {is} Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
<WEB Ezra 10.24>  Of the singers also; Eliashib. and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
<WEB Ezra 10.25>  Moreover, of Israel. of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
<WEB Ezra 10.26>  And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.
<WEB Ezra 10.27>  And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
<WEB Ezra 10.28>  Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, {and} Athlai.
<WEB Ezra 10.29>  And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
<WEB Ezra 10.30>  And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
<WEB Ezra 10.31>  And {of} the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
<WEB Ezra 10.32>  Benjamin, Malluch, {and} Shemariah.
<WEB Ezra 10.33>  Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, {and} Shimei.
<WEB Ezra 10.34>  Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
<WEB Ezra 10.35>  Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,
<WEB Ezra 10.36>  Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
<WEB Ezra 10.37>  Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,
<WEB Ezra 10.38>  And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,
<WEB Ezra 10.39>  And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,
<WEB Ezra 10.40>  Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
<WEB Ezra 10.41>  Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,
<WEB Ezra 10.42>  Shallum, Amariah, {and} Joseph.
<WEB Ezra 10.43>  Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah.
<WEB Ezra 10.44>  All these had taken foreign wives. and {some} of them had wives by whom they had children.
