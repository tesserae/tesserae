<WEB Genesis 1.1>  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.2>  And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness {was} upon the face of the deep. and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
<WEB Genesis 1.3>  And God said, Let there be light. and there was light.
<WEB Genesis 1.4>  And God saw the light, that {it was} good. and God divided the light from the darkness.
<WEB Genesis 1.5>  And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. and the evening and the morning were the first day.
<WEB Genesis 1.6>  And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
<WEB Genesis 1.7>  And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which {were} under the firmament from the waters which {were} above the firmament. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.8>  And God called the firmament Heaven. and the evening and the morning were the second day.
<WEB Genesis 1.9>  And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry {land} appear. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.10>  And God called the dry {land} Earth, and the collection of waters he called Seas. and God saw that it {was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.11>  And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, {and} the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed {is} in itself, upon the earth. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.12>  And the earth brought forth grass, {and} herb fyielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed {was} in itself, after its kind. and God saw that it {was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.13>  And the evening and the morning were the third day.
<WEB Genesis 1.14>  And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night. and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.
<WEB Genesis 1.15>  And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.16>  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. {he made} the stars also.
<WEB Genesis 1.17>  And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.18>  And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. and God saw that it {was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.19>  And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
<WEB Genesis 1.20>  And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl {that} may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
<WEB Genesis 1.21>  And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind. and God saw that {it was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.22>  And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.23>  And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
<WEB Genesis 1.24>  And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after his kind. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.25>  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind. and God saw that {it was} good.
<WEB Genesis 1.26>  And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.27>  So God created man in his {own} image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
<WEB Genesis 1.28>  And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it. and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living animal that moveth upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 1.29>  And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which {is} upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which {is} the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.
<WEB Genesis 1.30>  And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which {is} life, {I have given} every green herb for food. and it was so.
<WEB Genesis 1.31>  And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, {it was} very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
<WEB Genesis 2.1>  Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
<WEB Genesis 2.2>  And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
<WEB Genesis 2.3>  And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
<WEB Genesis 2.4>  These {are} the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
<WEB Genesis 2.5>  And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and {there was} not a man to till the ground.
<WEB Genesis 2.6>  But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
<WEB Genesis 2.7>  And the LORD God formed man {of} the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
<WEB Genesis 2.8>  And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
<WEB Genesis 2.9>  And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<WEB Genesis 2.10>  And a river went out of Eden to water the garden. and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
<WEB Genesis 2.11>  The name of the first {is} Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where {there is} gold;
<WEB Genesis 2.12>  And the gold of that land {is} good. there {is} bdellium and the onyx-stone.
<WEB Genesis 2.13>  And the name of the second river {is} Gihon. the same that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
<WEB Genesis 2.14>  And the name of the third river {is} Hiddekel. which floweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river {is} Euphrates.
<WEB Genesis 2.15>  And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.
<WEB Genesis 2.16>  And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat.
<WEB Genesis 2.17>  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die.
<WEB Genesis 2.18>  And the LORD God said, {It is} not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a help meet for him.
<WEB Genesis 2.19>  And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought {them} to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that {was} its name.
<WEB Genesis 2.20>  And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field. but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.
<WEB Genesis 2.21>  And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
<WEB Genesis 2.22>  And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman, and brought her to the man.
<WEB Genesis 2.23>  And Adam said, This {is} now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.
<WEB Genesis 2.24>  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife. and they shall be one flesh.
<WEB Genesis 2.25>  And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
<WEB Genesis 3.1>  Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
<WEB Genesis 3.2>  And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.
<WEB Genesis 3.3>  But of the fruit of the tree which {is} in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
<WEB Genesis 3.4>  And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.
<WEB Genesis 3.5>  For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened. and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
<WEB Genesis 3.6>  And when the woman saw that the tree {was} good for food, and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make {one} wise; she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
<WEB Genesis 3.7>  And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they {were} naked. and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves aprons.
<WEB Genesis 3.8>  And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
<WEB Genesis 3.9>  And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where {art} thou?
<WEB Genesis 3.10>  And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden. and I was afraid, because I {was} naked; and I hid myself.
<WEB Genesis 3.11>  And he said, Who told thee that thou {wast} naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?
<WEB Genesis 3.12>  And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest {to be} with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
<WEB Genesis 3.13>  And the LORD God said to the woman, What {is} this {that} thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.
<WEB Genesis 3.14>  And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou {art} cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
<WEB Genesis 3.15>  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
<WEB Genesis 3.16>  To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. and thy desire {shall be} to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
<WEB Genesis 3.17>  And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it. cursed {is} the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat {of} it all the days of thy life;
<WEB Genesis 3.18>  Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
<WEB Genesis 3.19>  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken. for dust thou {art}, and to dust shalt thou return.
<WEB Genesis 3.20>  And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
<WEB Genesis 3.21>  For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.
<WEB Genesis 3.22>  And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.
<WEB Genesis 3.23>  Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
<WEB Genesis 3.24>  So he drove out the man. and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
<WEB Genesis 4.1>  And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 4.2>  And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
<WEB Genesis 4.3>  And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 4.4>  And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering.
<WEB Genesis 4.5>  But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
<WEB Genesis 4.6>  And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
<WEB Genesis 4.7>  If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee {shall be} his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
<WEB Genesis 4.8>  And Cain talked with Abel his brother. and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
<WEB Genesis 4.9>  And the LORD said to Cain, Where {is} Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not. {Am} I my brother's keeper?
<WEB Genesis 4.10>  And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the ground.
<WEB Genesis 4.11>  And now {art} thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
<WEB Genesis 4.12>  When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength. A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
<WEB Genesis 4.13>  And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment {is} greater than I can bear.
<WEB Genesis 4.14>  Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it will come to pass, {that} every one that findeth me will slay me.
<WEB Genesis 4.15>  And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
<WEB Genesis 4.16>  And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
<WEB Genesis 4.17>  And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch. and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Enoch.
<WEB Genesis 4.18>  And to Enoch was born Irad. and Irad begat Mehujael. and Mehujael begat Methusael. and Methusael begat Lamech.
<WEB Genesis 4.19>  And Lamech took to him two wives. the name of the one {was} Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
<WEB Genesis 4.20>  And Adah bore Jabal. he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and {of such as have} cattle.
<WEB Genesis 4.21>  And his brother's name {was} Jubal. he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
<WEB Genesis 4.22>  And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron. and the sister of Tubalcain {was} Naamah.
<WEB Genesis 4.23>  And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech. for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
<WEB Genesis 4.24>  If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.
<WEB Genesis 4.25>  And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For God, {said she}, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
<WEB Genesis 4.26>  And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos. then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 5.1>  This {is} the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him.
<WEB Genesis 5.2>  Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
<WEB Genesis 5.3>  And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat {a son} in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth.
<WEB Genesis 5.4>  And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years. and he begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.5>  And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years. and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.6>  And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enos.
<WEB Genesis 5.7>  And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.8>  And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.9>  And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan.
<WEB Genesis 5.10>  And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.11>  And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.12>  And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel.
<WEB Genesis 5.13>  And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.14>  And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.15>  And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared.
<WEB Genesis 5.16>  And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.17>  And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.18>  And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch.
<WEB Genesis 5.19>  And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.20>  And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.21>  And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah.
<WEB Genesis 5.22>  And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.23>  And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years.
<WEB Genesis 5.24>  And Enoch walked with God, and he {was} not. for God took him.
<WEB Genesis 5.25>  And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.
<WEB Genesis 5.26>  And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.27>  And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.28>  And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years; and begat a son.
<WEB Genesis 5.29>  And he called his name Noah, saying, This {same} shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
<WEB Genesis 5.30>  And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 5.31>  And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
<WEB Genesis 5.32>  And Noah was five hundred years old. and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<WEB Genesis 6.1>  And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,
<WEB Genesis 6.2>  That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they {were} fair; and they took them wives of all whom they chose.
<WEB Genesis 6.3>  And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also {is} flesh. yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
<WEB Genesis 6.4>  There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore {children} to them. the same {became} mighty men, who {were} of old, men of renown.
<WEB Genesis 6.5>  And God saw that the wickedness of man {was} great in the earth, and {that} every imagination of the thoughts of his heart {was} only evil continually.
<WEB Genesis 6.6>  And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
<WEB Genesis 6.7>  And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping animal, and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made them.
<WEB Genesis 6.8>  But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 6.9>  These {are} the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man, {and} perfect in his generations, {and} Noah walked with God.
<WEB Genesis 6.10>  And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<WEB Genesis 6.11>  The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence.
<WEB Genesis 6.12>  And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt. for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 6.13>  And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them. and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
<WEB Genesis 6.14>  Make thee an ark of gopher-wood. rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
<WEB Genesis 6.15>  And this {is the fashion} in which thou shalt make it. the length of the ark {shall be} three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
<WEB Genesis 6.16>  A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side. {with} lower, second, and third {stories} shalt thou make it.
<WEB Genesis 6.17>  And behold, I, even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which {is} the breath of life, from under heaven. {and} every thing that {is} on the earth shall die.
<WEB Genesis 6.18>  But with thee will I establish my covenant. and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
<WEB Genesis 6.19>  And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every {sort} shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep {them} alive with thee. they shall be male and female.
<WEB Genesis 6.20>  Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping animal of the earth after its kind, two of every {sort} shall come to thee, to keep {them} alive.
<WEB Genesis 6.21>  And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather {it} to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
<WEB Genesis 6.22>  Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
<WEB Genesis 7.1>  And the LORD said to Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark. for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
<WEB Genesis 7.2>  Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female. and of beasts that {are} not clean by two, the male and his female.
<WEB Genesis 7.3>  Of fowls of the air also by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.4>  For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights. and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from the face of the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.5>  And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.
<WEB Genesis 7.6>  And Noah {was} six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.7>  And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
<WEB Genesis 7.8>  Of clean beasts, and of beasts that {are} not clean, and of fowls, and of every animal that creepeth upon the earth;
<WEB Genesis 7.9>  There went in two and two to Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
<WEB Genesis 7.10>  And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.11>  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
<WEB Genesis 7.12>  And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
<WEB Genesis 7.13>  In the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.
<WEB Genesis 7.14>  They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
<WEB Genesis 7.15>  And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which {is} the breath of life.
<WEB Genesis 7.16>  And they that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. and the LORD shut him in.
<WEB Genesis 7.17>  And the flood was forty days upon the earth. and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth.
<WEB Genesis 7.18>  And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth. and the ark moved upon the face of the waters.
<WEB Genesis 7.19>  And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that {were} under the whole heaven were covered.
<WEB Genesis 7.20>  Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail. and the mountains were covered.
<WEB Genesis 7.21>  And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth, and every man.
<WEB Genesis 7.22>  All in whose nostrils {was} the breath of life, of all that {was} on the dry {land}, died.
<WEB Genesis 7.23>  And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping animals, and the fowl of heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only remained {alive}, and they that {were} with him in the ark.
<WEB Genesis 7.24>  And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
<WEB Genesis 8.1>  And God remembered Noah, and every living animal, and all the cattle that {were} with him in the ark. and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were checked.
<WEB Genesis 8.2>  The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
<WEB Genesis 8.3>  And the waters returned from off the earth continually. and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
<WEB Genesis 8.4>  And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
<WEB Genesis 8.5>  And the waters decreased continually, till the tenth month. in the tenth {month}, on the first {day} of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
<WEB Genesis 8.6>  And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.
<WEB Genesis 8.7>  And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the waters were dried from off the earth.
<WEB Genesis 8.8>  Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
<WEB Genesis 8.9>  But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark; for the waters {were} on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.
<WEB Genesis 8.10>  And he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
<WEB Genesis 8.11>  And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth {was} an olive-leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
<WEB Genesis 8.12>  And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more.
<WEB Genesis 8.13>  And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first {month}, the first {day} of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
<WEB Genesis 8.14>  And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
<WEB Genesis 8.15>  And God spoke to Noah, saying,
<WEB Genesis 8.16>  Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
<WEB Genesis 8.17>  Bring forth with thee every living animal that {is} with thee, of all flesh, of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 8.18>  And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him.
<WEB Genesis 8.19>  Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, {and} whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark.
<WEB Genesis 8.20>  And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
<WEB Genesis 8.21>  And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart {is} evil from his youth. neither will I again smite any more every living animal as I have done.
<WEB Genesis 8.22>  While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
<WEB Genesis 9.1>  And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.2>  And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth {on} the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
<WEB Genesis 9.3>  Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
<WEB Genesis 9.4>  But flesh with the life of it, {which is} its blood, shall ye not eat.
<WEB Genesis 9.5>  And surely your blood of your lives will I require. at the hand of every beast will I require it. and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
<WEB Genesis 9.6>  Whoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. for in the image of God made he man.
<WEB Genesis 9.7>  And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply, bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
<WEB Genesis 9.8>  And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
<WEB Genesis 9.9>  And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
<WEB Genesis 9.10>  And with every living creature that {is} with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.11>  And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.12>  And God said, This {is} the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that {is} with you, for perpetual generations.
<WEB Genesis 9.13>  I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.14>  And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.
<WEB Genesis 9.15>  And I will remember my covenant, which {is} between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
<WEB Genesis 9.16>  And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that {is} upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.17>  And God said to Noah, This {is} the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that {is} upon the earth.
<WEB Genesis 9.18>  And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth. and Ham {was} the father of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 9.19>  These three {were} the sons of Noah. and from them was the whole earth overspread.
<WEB Genesis 9.20>  And Noah began {to be} a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard.
<WEB Genesis 9.21>  And he drank of the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent.
<WEB Genesis 9.22>  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
<WEB Genesis 9.23>  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid {it} upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. and their faces {were} backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
<WEB Genesis 9.24>  And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him.
<WEB Genesis 9.25>  And he said, Cursed {be} Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 9.26>  And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
<WEB Genesis 9.27>  God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
<WEB Genesis 9.28>  And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
<WEB Genesis 9.29>  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years. and he died.
<WEB Genesis 10.1>  Now these {are} the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, and Japheth. and to them were sons born after the flood.
<WEB Genesis 10.2>  The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
<WEB Genesis 10.3>  And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
<WEB Genesis 10.4>  And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
<WEB Genesis 10.5>  By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
<WEB Genesis 10.6>  And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 10.7>  And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah, Sheba, and Dedan.
<WEB Genesis 10.8>  And Cush begat Nimrod. he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
<WEB Genesis 10.9>  He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 10.10>  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
<WEB Genesis 10.11>  Out of that land went forth Ashur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
<WEB Genesis 10.12>  And Resen between Nineveh and Calah. the same {is} a great city.
<WEB Genesis 10.13>  And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim.
<WEB Genesis 10.14>  And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.
<WEB Genesis 10.15>  And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
<WEB Genesis 10.16>  And the Jebusite, and the Emorite, and the Girgasite,
<WEB Genesis 10.17>  And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
<WEB Genesis 10.18>  And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. and afterward were the families of the Canaanites dispersed.
<WEB Genesis 10.19>  And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, to Gaza; as thou goest to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lashah.
<WEB Genesis 10.20>  These {are} the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, {and} in their nations.
<WEB Genesis 10.21>  To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were {children} born.
<WEB Genesis 10.22>  The children of Shem; Elam, and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
<WEB Genesis 10.23>  And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
<WEB Genesis 10.24>  And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
<WEB Genesis 10.25>  And to Eber were born two sons. the name of one {was} Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name {was} Joktan.
<WEB Genesis 10.26>  And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
<WEB Genesis 10.27>  And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah.
<WEB Genesis 10.28>  And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
<WEB Genesis 10.29>  And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab. all these {were} the sons of Joktan.
<WEB Genesis 10.30>  And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest to Sephar, a mount of the east.
<WEB Genesis 10.31>  These {are} the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
<WEB Genesis 10.32>  These {are} the families of the sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations. and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
<WEB Genesis 11.1>  And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
<WEB Genesis 11.2>  And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.
<WEB Genesis 11.3>  And they said one to another, come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
<WEB Genesis 11.4>  And they said, come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top {may reach} to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we should be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
<WEB Genesis 11.5>  And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men were building.
<WEB Genesis 11.6>  And the LORD said, Behold, the people {is} one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do. and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
<WEB Genesis 11.7>  Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
<WEB Genesis 11.8>  So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. and they left off to build the city.
<WEB Genesis 11.9>  Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the LORD there confounded the language of all the earth. and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
<WEB Genesis 11.10>  These {are} the generations of Shem. Shem {was} a hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood.
<WEB Genesis 11.11>  And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.12>  And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah.
<WEB Genesis 11.13>  And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.14>  And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber.
<WEB Genesis 11.15>  And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.16>  And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg.
<WEB Genesis 11.17>  And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.18>  And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu.
<WEB Genesis 11.19>  And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.20>  And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug.
<WEB Genesis 11.21>  And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.22>  And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor.
<WEB Genesis 11.23>  And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.24>  And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah.
<WEB Genesis 11.25>  And Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
<WEB Genesis 11.26>  And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
<WEB Genesis 11.27>  Now these {are} the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. and Haran begat Lot.
<WEB Genesis 11.28>  And Haran died before his father Terah, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
<WEB Genesis 11.29>  And Abram and Nahor took them wives. the name of Abram's wife {was} Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
<WEB Genesis 11.30>  But Sarai {was} barren; she had no child.
<WEB Genesis 11.31>  And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelt there.
<WEB Genesis 11.32>  And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years. and Terah died in Haran.
<WEB Genesis 12.1>  Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to a land that I will show thee.
<WEB Genesis 12.2>  And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.
<WEB Genesis 12.3>  And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee. and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
<WEB Genesis 12.4>  So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. and Abram {was} seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran.
<WEB Genesis 12.5>  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
<WEB Genesis 12.6>  And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite {was} then in the land.
<WEB Genesis 12.7>  And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land. and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.
<WEB Genesis 12.8>  And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, {having} Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east. and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 12.9>  And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south.
<WEB Genesis 12.10>  And there was a famine in the land. and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine {was} grievous in the land.
<WEB Genesis 12.11>  And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou {art} a fair woman to look upon.
<WEB Genesis 12.12>  Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This {is} his wife. and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
<WEB Genesis 12.13>  Say, I pray thee, thou {art} my sister. that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
<WEB Genesis 12.14>  And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she {was} very fair.
<WEB Genesis 12.15>  The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh. and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
<WEB Genesis 12.16>  And he treated Abram well for her sake. and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
<WEB Genesis 12.17>  And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
<WEB Genesis 12.18>  And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What {is} this {that} thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she {is} thy wife?
<WEB Genesis 12.19>  Why saidst thou, She {is} my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife. now therefore behold thy wife, take {her}, and go thy way.
<WEB Genesis 12.20>  And Pharaoh commanded {his} men concerning him. and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
<WEB Genesis 13.1>  And Abram returned from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
<WEB Genesis 13.2>  And Abram {was} very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
<WEB Genesis 13.3>  And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai;
<WEB Genesis 13.4>  To the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 13.5>  And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
<WEB Genesis 13.6>  And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together. for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
<WEB Genesis 13.7>  And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle. and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
<WEB Genesis 13.8>  And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we {are} brethren.
<WEB Genesis 13.9>  {Is} not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. if {thou wilt take} the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if {thou wilt depart} to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
<WEB Genesis 13.10>  And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it {was} well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, {even} as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest to Zoar.
<WEB Genesis 13.11>  Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east. and they separated themselves the one from the other.
<WEB Genesis 13.12>  Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched {his} tent towards Sodom.
<WEB Genesis 13.13>  But the men of Sodom {were} wicked, and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly.
<WEB Genesis 13.14>  And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward.
<WEB Genesis 13.15>  For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
<WEB Genesis 13.16>  And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, {then} shall thy seed also be numbered.
<WEB Genesis 13.17>  Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee.
<WEB Genesis 13.18>  Then Abram removed {his} tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which {is} in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 14.1>  And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
<WEB Genesis 14.2>  {That these} made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
<WEB Genesis 14.3>  All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
<WEB Genesis 14.4>  Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
<WEB Genesis 14.5>  And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that {were} with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
<WEB Genesis 14.6>  And the Horites in their mount Seir, to El-paran, which {is} by the wilderness.
<WEB Genesis 14.7>  And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which {is} Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
<WEB Genesis 14.8>  And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, (the same {is} Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
<WEB Genesis 14.9>  With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
<WEB Genesis 14.10>  And the vale of Siddim {was full of} slime-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there. and they that remained fled to the mountain.
<WEB Genesis 14.11>  And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
<WEB Genesis 14.12>  And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
<WEB Genesis 14.13>  And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner. and these {were} confederate with Abram.
<WEB Genesis 14.14>  And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained {servants}, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued {them} to Dan.
<WEB Genesis 14.15>  And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which {is} on the left hand of Damascus.
<WEB Genesis 14.16>  And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
<WEB Genesis 14.17>  And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that {were} with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which {is} the king's dale.
<WEB Genesis 14.18>  And Melchisedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine. and he {was} the priest of the most high God.
<WEB Genesis 14.19>  And he blessed him, and said, Blessed {be} Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth.
<WEB Genesis 14.20>  And blessed be the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
<WEB Genesis 14.21>  And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
<WEB Genesis 14.22>  And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
<WEB Genesis 14.23>  That I will not {take} from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that {is} thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich.
<WEB Genesis 14.24>  Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
<WEB Genesis 15.1>  After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram. I {am} thy shield, {and} thy exceeding great reward.
<WEB Genesis 15.2>  And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house {is} this Eliezer of Damascus?
<WEB Genesis 15.3>  And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed. and lo, one born in my house is my heir.
<WEB Genesis 15.4>  And behold, the word of the LORD {came} to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir.
<WEB Genesis 15.5>  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards heaven, and tell the stars, if thou art able to number them. and he said to him, So shall thy seed be.
<WEB Genesis 15.6>  And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
<WEB Genesis 15.7>  And he said to him, I {am} the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
<WEB Genesis 15.8>  And he said, Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?
<WEB Genesis 15.9>  And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
<WEB Genesis 15.10>  And he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another. but the birds he did not divide.
<WEB Genesis 15.11>  And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
<WEB Genesis 15.12>  And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
<WEB Genesis 15.13>  And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land {that is} not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
<WEB Genesis 15.14>  And also that nation which they shall serve, will I judge. and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
<WEB Genesis 15.15>  And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
<WEB Genesis 15.16>  But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again. for the iniquity of the Amorites {is} not yet full.
<WEB Genesis 15.17>  And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
<WEB Genesis 15.18>  In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.
<WEB Genesis 15.19>  The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
<WEB Genesis 15.20>  And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
<WEB Genesis 15.21>  And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
<WEB Genesis 16.1>  Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children. and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name {was} Hagar.
<WEB Genesis 16.2>  And Sarai said to Abram, Behold, now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
<WEB Genesis 16.3>  And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
<WEB Genesis 16.4>  And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
<WEB Genesis 16.5>  And Sarai said to Abram, my wrong {be} upon thee. I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. the LORD judge between me and thee.
<WEB Genesis 16.6>  But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid {is} in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
<WEB Genesis 16.7>  And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
<WEB Genesis 16.8>  And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
<WEB Genesis 16.9>  And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
<WEB Genesis 16.10>  And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
<WEB Genesis 16.11>  And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, thou {art} with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
<WEB Genesis 16.12>  And he will be a wild man; his hand {will be} against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 16.13>  And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, Thou God seest me. for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
<WEB Genesis 16.14>  Wherefore the well was called Beer-la-hai-roi; behold, {it is} between Kadesh and Bered.
<WEB Genesis 16.15>  And Hagar bore Abram a son. and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.
<WEB Genesis 16.16>  And Abram {was} eighty six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
<WEB Genesis 17.1>  And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I {am} the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
<WEB Genesis 17.2>  And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
<WEB Genesis 17.3>  And Abram fell on his face. and God talked with him, saying,
<WEB Genesis 17.4>  As for me, behold, my covenant {is} with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
<WEB Genesis 17.5>  Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
<WEB Genesis 17.6>  And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee; and kings shall proceed from thee.
<WEB Genesis 17.7>  And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant; to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.
<WEB Genesis 17.8>  And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
<WEB Genesis 17.9>  And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee, in their generations.
<WEB Genesis 17.10>  This {is} my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee; Every male-child among you shall be circumcised.
<WEB Genesis 17.11>  And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
<WEB Genesis 17.12>  And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male-child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who {is} not of thy seed.
<WEB Genesis 17.13>  He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised. and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
<WEB Genesis 17.14>  And the uncircumcised male-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
<WEB Genesis 17.15>  And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah {shall} her name {be}.
<WEB Genesis 17.16>  And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her. yea, I will bless her, and she shall be {a mother} of nations; kings of people shall proceed from her.
<WEB Genesis 17.17>  Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall {a child} be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?
<WEB Genesis 17.18>  And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
<WEB Genesis 17.19>  And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac. and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, {and} with his seed after him.
<WEB Genesis 17.20>  And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
<WEB Genesis 17.21>  But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year.
<WEB Genesis 17.22>  And he ceased talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
<WEB Genesis 17.23>  And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, in the same day, as God had said to him.
<WEB Genesis 17.24>  And Abraham {was} ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
<WEB Genesis 17.25>  And Ishmael his son {was} thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
<WEB Genesis 17.26>  In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
<WEB Genesis 17.27>  And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
<WEB Genesis 18.1>  And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre. and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
<WEB Genesis 18.2>  And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him. and when he saw {them}, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
<WEB Genesis 18.3>  And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.
<WEB Genesis 18.4>  Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
<WEB Genesis 18.5>  And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on. for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
<WEB Genesis 18.6>  And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead {it}, and make cakes upon the hearth.
<WEB Genesis 18.7>  And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave {it} to a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
<WEB Genesis 18.8>  And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set {it} before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
<WEB Genesis 18.9>  And they said to him, Where {is} Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
<WEB Genesis 18.10>  And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard {it} in the tent door, which {was} behind him.
<WEB Genesis 18.11>  Now Abraham and Sarah {were} old {and} far advanced in age; {and} it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
<WEB Genesis 18.12>  Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
<WEB Genesis 18.13>  And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?
<WEB Genesis 18.14>  Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
<WEB Genesis 18.15>  Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
<WEB Genesis 18.16>  And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom. and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
<WEB Genesis 18.17>  And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
<WEB Genesis 18.18>  Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
<WEB Genesis 18.19>  For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
<WEB Genesis 18.20>  And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
<WEB Genesis 18.21>  I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.
<WEB Genesis 18.22>  And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards Sodom. but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 18.23>  And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
<WEB Genesis 18.24>  Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city. wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that {are} in it?
<WEB Genesis 18.25>  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked. and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
<WEB Genesis 18.26>  And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
<WEB Genesis 18.27>  And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I, who {am} dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 18.28>  Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous. wilt thou destroy all the city for {lack of} five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy {it}.
<WEB Genesis 18.29>  And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do {it} for forty's sake.
<WEB Genesis 18.30>  And he said, Oh, let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak. Peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do {it}, if I find thirty there.
<WEB Genesis 18.31>  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the LORD. Peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy {it} for twenty's sake.
<WEB Genesis 18.32>  And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy {it} for ten's sake.
<WEB Genesis 18.33>  And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham. and Abraham returned to his place.
<WEB Genesis 19.1>  And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot seeing {them}, rose to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground;
<WEB Genesis 19.2>  And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
<WEB Genesis 19.3>  And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
<WEB Genesis 19.4>  But before they lay down, the men of the city, {even} the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter.
<WEB Genesis 19.5>  And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where {are} the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.
<WEB Genesis 19.6>  And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,
<WEB Genesis 19.7>  And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
<WEB Genesis 19.8>  Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as {is} good in your eyes. only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
<WEB Genesis 19.9>  And they said, Stand back. And they said {again}, This one {man} came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge. Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door.
<WEB Genesis 19.10>  But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
<WEB Genesis 19.11>  And they smote the men that {were} at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great. so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
<WEB Genesis 19.12>  And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatever thou hast in the city, bring {them} out of this place.
<WEB Genesis 19.13>  For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
<WEB Genesis 19.14>  And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. but he seemed to his sons-in-law as one that mocked.
<WEB Genesis 19.15>  And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
<WEB Genesis 19.16>  And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters. the LORD being merciful to him. and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
<WEB Genesis 19.17>  And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life. look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain. escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
<WEB Genesis 19.18>  And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my Lord!
<WEB Genesis 19.19>  Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life. and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die.
<WEB Genesis 19.20>  Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it {is} a small one. Oh, let me escape thither! ({Is} it not a small one?) and my soul shall live.
<WEB Genesis 19.21>  And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken.
<WEB Genesis 19.22>  Haste thee, escape thither. for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither. therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
<WEB Genesis 19.23>  The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
<WEB Genesis 19.24>  Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
<WEB Genesis 19.25>  And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
<WEB Genesis 19.26>  But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
<WEB Genesis 19.27>  And Abraham rose early in the morning, to the place were he stood before the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 19.28>  And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
<WEB Genesis 19.29>  And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
<WEB Genesis 19.30>  And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar. and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters.
<WEB Genesis 19.31>  And the first-born said to the younger, Our father {is} old, and {there is} not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
<WEB Genesis 19.32>  Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
<WEB Genesis 19.33>  And they made their father drink wine that night. and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
<WEB Genesis 19.34>  And it came to pass on the morrow that the first born said to the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, {and} lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
<WEB Genesis 19.35>  And they made their father drink wine that night also. and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
<WEB Genesis 19.36>  Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
<WEB Genesis 19.37>  And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab. the same {is} the father of the Moabites to this day.
<WEB Genesis 19.38>  And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi. the same {is} the father of the children of Ammon to this day.
<WEB Genesis 20.1>  And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadash and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
<WEB Genesis 20.2>  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
<WEB Genesis 20.3>  But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou {art but} a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken. for she {is} a man's wife.
<WEB Genesis 20.4>  But Abimelech had not come near her. and he said, LORD, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?
<WEB Genesis 20.5>  Said he not to me, She {is} my sister? and she, even she herself said, He {is} my brother. in the integrity of my heart, and innocence of my hands have I done this.
<WEB Genesis 20.6>  And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me. therefore I suffered thee not to touch her.
<WEB Genesis 20.7>  Now therefore restore to the man {his} wife, for he {is} a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. and if thou shalt not restore {her}, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that {are} thine.
<WEB Genesis 20.8>  Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears. and the men were greatly afraid.
<WEB Genesis 20.9>  Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What has thou done to us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done.
<WEB Genesis 20.10>  And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
<WEB Genesis 20.11>  And Abraham said, Because I thought, surely the fear of God {is} not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
<WEB Genesis 20.12>  And yet indeed {she is} my sister. she {is} the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
<WEB Genesis 20.13>  And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This {is} thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He {is} my brother.
<WEB Genesis 20.14>  And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave {them} to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.
<WEB Genesis 20.15>  And Abimelech said, Behold, my land {is} before thee. dwell where it pleaseth thee.
<WEB Genesis 20.16>  And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand {pieces} of silver. behold, he {is} to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that {are} with thee, and with all {other}. thus she was reproved.
<WEB Genesis 20.17>  So Abraham prayed to God. and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore {children}.
<WEB Genesis 20.18>  For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
<WEB Genesis 21.1>  And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.
<WEB Genesis 21.2>  For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
<WEB Genesis 21.3>  And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 21.4>  And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
<WEB Genesis 21.5>  And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.
<WEB Genesis 21.6>  And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, {so that} all that hear will laugh with me.
<WEB Genesis 21.7>  And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne him a son in his old age.
<WEB Genesis 21.8>  And the child grew, and was weaned. and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.
<WEB Genesis 21.9>  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
<WEB Genesis 21.10>  Wherefore, she said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman, and her son. for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, {even} with Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 21.11>  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son.
<WEB Genesis 21.12>  And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice. for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
<WEB Genesis 21.13>  And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he {is} thy seed.
<WEB Genesis 21.14>  And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave {it} to Hagar (putting {it} on her shoulder) and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
<WEB Genesis 21.15>  And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
<WEB Genesis 21.16>  And she went, and sat her down over against {him}, a good way off, as it were a bow-shot. for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against {him}, and raised her voice, and wept.
<WEB Genesis 21.17>  And God heard the voice of the lad. and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he {is}.
<WEB Genesis 21.18>  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand. for I will make him a great nation.
<WEB Genesis 21.19>  And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
<WEB Genesis 21.20>  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
<WEB Genesis 21.21>  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. and his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 21.22>  And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God {is} with thee in all that thou doest.
<WEB Genesis 21.23>  Now therefore swear to me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. {but} according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou hast sojourned.
<WEB Genesis 21.24>  And Abraham said, I will swear.
<WEB Genesis 21.25>  And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
<WEB Genesis 21.26>  And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing. neither didst thou tell me, neither yet have I heard {of it}, but to-day.
<WEB Genesis 21.27>  And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech. and both of them made a covenant.
<WEB Genesis 21.28>  And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
<WEB Genesis 21.29>  And Abimelech said to Abraham, What {mean} these seven ewe-lambs, which thou hast set by themselves?
<WEB Genesis 21.30>  And he said, For {these} seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have digged this well.
<WEB Genesis 21.31>  Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba. because there they swore both of them.
<WEB Genesis 21.32>  Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. Then Abimelech arose, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
<WEB Genesis 21.33>  And {Abraham} planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
<WEB Genesis 21.34>  And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
<WEB Genesis 22.1>  And it came to pass after these things, that God tempted Abraham, and said to him, Abraham. and he said, Behold, {here} I {am}.
<WEB Genesis 22.2>  And he said, Take now thy son, thy only {son} Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to thee.
<WEB Genesis 22.3>  And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cleft the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him.
<WEB Genesis 22.4>  Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
<WEB Genesis 22.5>  And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and return to you.
<WEB Genesis 22.6>  And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid {it} upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife. and they went both of them together.
<WEB Genesis 22.7>  And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father. and he said, here {am} I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood. but where {is} the lamb for a burnt-offering?
<WEB Genesis 22.8>  And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering. so they went both of them together.
<WEB Genesis 22.9>  And they came to the place which God had named to him; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order; and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
<WEB Genesis 22.10>  And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
<WEB Genesis 22.11>  And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here {am} I.
<WEB Genesis 22.12>  And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing to him. for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld from me thy son, thy only {son}.
<WEB Genesis 22.13>  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind {him} a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
<WEB Genesis 22.14>  And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. as it is said {to} this day, In the mount of the LORD it will be seen.
<WEB Genesis 22.15>  And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time,
<WEB Genesis 22.16>  And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only {son}.
<WEB Genesis 22.17>  That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which {is} on the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
<WEB Genesis 22.18>  And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. because thou hast obeyed my voice.
<WEB Genesis 22.19>  So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
<WEB Genesis 22.20>  And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children to thy brother Nahor;
<WEB Genesis 22.21>  Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
<WEB Genesis 22.22>  And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
<WEB Genesis 22.23>  And Bethuel begat Rebekah. these eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham's brother.
<WEB Genesis 22.24>  And his concubine, whose name {was} Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
<WEB Genesis 23.1>  And Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years old. {these were} the years of the life of Sarah.
<WEB Genesis 23.2>  And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same {is} Hebron in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
<WEB Genesis 23.3>  And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
<WEB Genesis 23.4>  I {am} a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
<WEB Genesis 23.5>  And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
<WEB Genesis 23.6>  Hear us, my lord; thou {art} a mighty prince among us. in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead. none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
<WEB Genesis 23.7>  And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.
<WEB Genesis 23.8>  And he communed with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
<WEB Genesis 23.9>  That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which {is} in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession of a burying-place among you.
<WEB Genesis 23.10>  And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, of all that entered the gates of his city, saying,
<WEB Genesis 23.11>  Nay, my lord, hear me. the field give I to thee, and the cave that {is} in it, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to thee. bury thy dead.
<WEB Genesis 23.12>  And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land.
<WEB Genesis 23.13>  And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou {wilt give it}, I pray thee, hear me. I will give thee money for the field. take {it} of me, and I will bury my dead there.
<WEB Genesis 23.14>  And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
<WEB Genesis 23.15>  My lord, hearken to me. the land {is worth} four hundred shekels of silver; what {is} that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
<WEB Genesis 23.16>  And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current {money} with the merchant.
<WEB Genesis 23.17>  And the field of Ephron, which {was} in Machpelah, which {was} before Mamre, the field and the cave which {was} in it, and all the trees that {were} in the field, that {were} in all the borders round about, were made sure
<WEB Genesis 23.18>  To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that entered the gate of his city.
<WEB Genesis 23.19>  And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre. the same {is} Hebron in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 23.20>  And the field, and the cave that {is} in it were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, by the sons of Heth.
<WEB Genesis 24.1>  And Abraham was old {and} far advanced in age. and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
<WEB Genesis 24.2>  And Abraham said to his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh.
<WEB Genesis 24.3>  And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell.
<WEB Genesis 24.4>  But thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 24.5>  And the servant said to him, It may be the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou camest?
<WEB Genesis 24.6>  And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again.
<WEB Genesis 24.7>  The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land. he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
<WEB Genesis 24.8>  And if the woman shall not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only bring not my son thither again.
<WEB Genesis 24.9>  And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.
<WEB Genesis 24.10>  And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; (for all the goods of his master {were} in his hands.) and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
<WEB Genesis 24.11>  And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw {water}.
<WEB Genesis 24.12>  And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, prosper me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
<WEB Genesis 24.13>  Behold, I stand {here} by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water.
<WEB Genesis 24.14>  And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. {let the same be} she {that} thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and by that shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master.
<WEB Genesis 24.15>  And it came to pass before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
<WEB Genesis 24.16>  And the damsel {was} very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
<WEB Genesis 24.17>  And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher.
<WEB Genesis 24.18>  And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
<WEB Genesis 24.19>  And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw {water} for thy camels also, till they have done drinking.
<WEB Genesis 24.20>  And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw {water}, and drew for all his camels.
<WEB Genesis 24.21>  And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous, or not.
<WEB Genesis 24.22>  And it came to pass as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ear-ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten {shekels} weight of gold;
<WEB Genesis 24.23>  And said, Whose daughter {art} thou? tell me, I pray thee. is there room {in} thy father's house for us to lodge in?
<WEB Genesis 24.24>  And she said to him, I {am} the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
<WEB Genesis 24.25>  She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
<WEB Genesis 24.26>  And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 24.27>  And he said, Blessed {be} the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left my master destitute of his mercy and his truth. I {being} in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.
<WEB Genesis 24.28>  And the damsel ran, and told these things to her mother's house.
<WEB Genesis 24.29>  And Rebekah had a brother, and his name {was} Laban. and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.
<WEB Genesis 24.30>  And it came to pass when he saw the ear-ring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
<WEB Genesis 24.31>  And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
<WEB Genesis 24.32>  And the man came into the house. and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that {were} with him.
<WEB Genesis 24.33>  And there was set {food} before him to eat. but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.
<WEB Genesis 24.34>  And he said, I {am} Abraham's servant.
<WEB Genesis 24.35>  And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly, and he is become great. and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses.
<WEB Genesis 24.36>  And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. and to him hath he given all that he hath.
<WEB Genesis 24.37>  And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.
<WEB Genesis 24.38>  But thou shalt go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
<WEB Genesis 24.39>  And I said to my master, It may be the woman will not follow me.
<WEB Genesis 24.40>  And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.
<WEB Genesis 24.41>  Then shalt thou be clear from {this} my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee {one}, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
<WEB Genesis 24.42>  And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way which I go.
<WEB Genesis 24.43>  Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw {water}, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
<WEB Genesis 24.44>  And she saith to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels. {let} the same {be} the woman whom the LORD hath pointed out for my master's son.
<WEB Genesis 24.45>  And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew {water}. and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
<WEB Genesis 24.46>  And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her {shoulder}, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
<WEB Genesis 24.47>  And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter {art} thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. and I put the ear-ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
<WEB Genesis 24.48>  And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
<WEB Genesis 24.49>  And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
<WEB Genesis 24.50>  Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD. we cannot speak to thee bad or good.
<WEB Genesis 24.51>  Behold, Rebekah {is} before thee, take {her}, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
<WEB Genesis 24.52>  And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, {bowing himself} to the earth.
<WEB Genesis 24.53>  And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave {them} to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
<WEB Genesis 24.54>  And they ate and drank, he and the men that {were} with him, and tarried all night; and they rose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.
<WEB Genesis 24.55>  And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us {a few} days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
<WEB Genesis 24.56>  And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way. send me away, that I may go to my master.
<WEB Genesis 24.57>  And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
<WEB Genesis 24.58>  And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
<WEB Genesis 24.59>  And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
<WEB Genesis 24.60>  And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou {art} our sister, be thou {the mother} of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.
<WEB Genesis 24.61>  And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
<WEB Genesis 24.62>  And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
<WEB Genesis 24.63>  And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening. and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels {were} coming.
<WEB Genesis 24.64>  And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
<WEB Genesis 24.65>  For she {had} said to the servant, What man {is} this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant {had} said, It {is} my master. therefore she took a vail and covered herself.
<WEB Genesis 24.66>  And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
<WEB Genesis 24.67>  And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. and Isaac was comforted after his mother's {death}.
<WEB Genesis 25.1>  Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name {was} Keturah.
<WEB Genesis 25.2>  And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
<WEB Genesis 25.3>  And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim and Leummim.
<WEB Genesis 25.4>  And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these {were} the children of Keturah.
<WEB Genesis 25.5>  And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 25.6>  But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward, to the east country.
<WEB Genesis 25.7>  And these {are} the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred and seventy five years.
<WEB Genesis 25.8>  Then Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full {of years}; and was gathered to his people.
<WEB Genesis 25.9>  And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which {is} before Mamre;
<WEB Genesis 25.10>  The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth. there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
<WEB Genesis 25.11>  And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
<WEB Genesis 25.12>  Now these {are} the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.
<WEB Genesis 25.13>  And these {are} the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations. The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
<WEB Genesis 25.14>  And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
<WEB Genesis 25.15>  Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
<WEB Genesis 25.16>  These {are} the sons of Ishmael, and these {are} their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
<WEB Genesis 25.17>  And these {are} the years of the life of Ishmael; a hundred and thirty and seven years. and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.
<WEB Genesis 25.18>  And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that {is} before Egypt, as thou goest towards Assyria. {and} he died in the presence of all his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 25.19>  And these {are} the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begat Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 25.20>  And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
<WEB Genesis 25.21>  And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she {was} barren. and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
<WEB Genesis 25.22>  And the children struggled together within her. and she said, If {it is} so, why {am} I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 25.23>  And the LORD said to her, Two nations {are} in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels. and {the one} people shall be stronger than {the other} people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
<WEB Genesis 25.24>  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, {there were} twins in her womb.
<WEB Genesis 25.25>  And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment. and they called his name Esau.
<WEB Genesis 25.26>  And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. and Isaac {was} sixty years old when she bore them.
<WEB Genesis 25.27>  And the boys grew. and Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob {was} a plain man dwelling in tents.
<WEB Genesis 25.28>  And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of {his} venison. but Rebekah loved Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 25.29>  And Jacob boiled pottage. and Esau came from the field, and he {was} faint.
<WEB Genesis 25.30>  And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red {pottage}; for I {am} faint. therefore was his name called Edom.
<WEB Genesis 25.31>  And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birth-right.
<WEB Genesis 25.32>  And Esau said, Behold, I {am} at the point to die. and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?
<WEB Genesis 25.33>  And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him. and he sold his birth-right to Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 25.34>  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way. thus Esau despised {his} birth-right.
<WEB Genesis 26.1>  And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.
<WEB Genesis 26.2>  And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
<WEB Genesis 26.3>  Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. for to thee, and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;
<WEB Genesis 26.4>  And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries. and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
<WEB Genesis 26.5>  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
<WEB Genesis 26.6>  And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
<WEB Genesis 26.7>  And the men of the place asked {him} of his wife; and he said, She {is} my sister. for he feared to say, {She is} my wife; lest, {said he}, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she {was} fair to look upon.
<WEB Genesis 26.8>  And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac {was} sporting with Rebekah his wife.
<WEB Genesis 26.9>  And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she {is} thy wife. and how saidst thou, She {is} my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I should die on her account.
<WEB Genesis 26.10>  And Abimelech said, What {is} this thou hast done to us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us.
<WEB Genesis 26.11>  And Abimelech charged all {his} people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
<WEB Genesis 26.12>  Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold. and the LORD blessed him.
<WEB Genesis 26.13>  And the man became great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great.
<WEB Genesis 26.14>  For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants. And the Philistines envied him.
<WEB Genesis 26.15>  For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
<WEB Genesis 26.16>  And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us. for thou art much mightier than we.
<WEB Genesis 26.17>  And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
<WEB Genesis 26.18>  And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
<WEB Genesis 26.19>  And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
<WEB Genesis 26.20>  And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water {is} ours. and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
<WEB Genesis 26.21>  And they digged another well, and contended for that also. and he called the name of it Sitnah.
<WEB Genesis 26.22>  And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they did not contend. and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
<WEB Genesis 26.23>  And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
<WEB Genesis 26.24>  And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I {am} the God of Abraham thy father. fear not, for I {am} with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
<WEB Genesis 26.25>  And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there. and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
<WEB Genesis 26.26>  Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
<WEB Genesis 26.27>  And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
<WEB Genesis 26.28>  And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee. and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, {even} betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
<WEB Genesis 26.29>  That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. thou {art} now the blessed of the LORD.
<WEB Genesis 26.30>  And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
<WEB Genesis 26.31>  And they rose betimes in the morning, and swore one to another. and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
<WEB Genesis 26.32>  And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water.
<WEB Genesis 26.33>  And he called it Shebah. therefore the name of the city {is} Beer-sheba to this day.
<WEB Genesis 26.34>  And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
<WEB Genesis 26.35>  Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
<WEB Genesis 27.1>  And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said to him, My son. and he said to him, Behold, {here am} I.
<WEB Genesis 27.2>  And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
<WEB Genesis 27.3>  Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me {some} venison;
<WEB Genesis 27.4>  And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring {it} to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
<WEB Genesis 27.5>  And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt {for} venison, {and} to bring it.
<WEB Genesis 27.6>  And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,
<WEB Genesis 27.7>  Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD, before my death.
<WEB Genesis 27.8>  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command thee.
<WEB Genesis 27.9>  Go now to the flock, and bring me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth.
<WEB Genesis 27.10>  And thou shalt bring {it} to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.
<WEB Genesis 27.11>  And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother {is} a hairy man, and I {am} a smooth man.
<WEB Genesis 27.12>  My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
<WEB Genesis 27.13>  And his mother said to him, upon me {be} thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.
<WEB Genesis 27.14>  And he went, and took, and brought {them} to his mother. and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.
<WEB Genesis 27.15>  And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son.
<WEB Genesis 27.16>  And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck.
<WEB Genesis 27.17>  And she gave the savory meat, and the bread which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 27.18>  And he came to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here {am} I; who {art} thou, my son?
<WEB Genesis 27.19>  And Jacob said to his father, I {am} Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me. arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
<WEB Genesis 27.20>  And Isaac said to his son, How {is it} that thou hast found {it} so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought {it} to me.
<WEB Genesis 27.21>  And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou {art} my very son Esau, or not.
<WEB Genesis 27.22>  And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice {is} Jacob's voice, but the hands {are} the hands of Esau.
<WEB Genesis 27.23>  And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.
<WEB Genesis 27.24>  And he said, {Art} thou my very son Esau? And he said, I {am}.
<WEB Genesis 27.25>  And he said, bring {it} near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought {it} near to him, and he ate. and he brought him wine, and he drank.
<WEB Genesis 27.26>  And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
<WEB Genesis 27.27>  And he came near, and kissed him. and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son {is} as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed.
<WEB Genesis 27.28>  Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine.
<WEB Genesis 27.29>  Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. cursed {be} every one that curseth thee, and blessed {be} he that blesseth thee.
<WEB Genesis 27.30>  And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
<WEB Genesis 27.31>  And he also had made savory meat, and brought it to his father; and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
<WEB Genesis 27.32>  And Isaac his father said to him, Who {art} thou? And he said, I {am} thy son, thy first-born Esau.
<WEB Genesis 27.33>  And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where {is} he that hath taken venison, and brought {it} me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, {and} he shall be blessed.
<WEB Genesis 27.34>  And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, {even} me also, O my father.
<WEB Genesis 27.35>  And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
<WEB Genesis 27.36>  And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice. he took away my birth-right; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
<WEB Genesis 27.37>  And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him. and what shall I do now to thee, my son?
<WEB Genesis 27.38>  And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, {even} me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
<WEB Genesis 27.39>  And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
<WEB Genesis 27.40>  And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother. and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
<WEB Genesis 27.41>  And Esau hated Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 27.42>  And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself, {purposing} to kill thee.
<WEB Genesis 27.43>  Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
<WEB Genesis 27.44>  And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury shall turn away;
<WEB Genesis 27.45>  Till thy brother's anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget {that} which thou hast done to him. then I will send, and bring thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
<WEB Genesis 27.46>  And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth. if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these {who are} of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?
<WEB Genesis 28.1>  And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 28.2>  Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
<WEB Genesis 28.3>  And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
<WEB Genesis 28.4>  And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land in which thou art a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.
<WEB Genesis 28.5>  And Isaac sent away Jacob. and he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
<WEB Genesis 28.6>  When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
<WEB Genesis 28.7>  And that Jacob obeyed his father, and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;
<WEB Genesis 28.8>  And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
<WEB Genesis 28.9>  Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
<WEB Genesis 28.10>  And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards Haran.
<WEB Genesis 28.11>  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. and he took of the stones of that place, and put {them for} his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
<WEB Genesis 28.12>  And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
<WEB Genesis 28.13>  And behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I {am} the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
<WEB Genesis 28.14>  And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
<WEB Genesis 28.15>  And behold, I {am} with thee, and will keep thee in all {places} whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. for I will not leave thee, until I have done {that} which I have declared to thee.
<WEB Genesis 28.16>  And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew {it} not.
<WEB Genesis 28.17>  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful {is} this place! this {is} no other but the house of God, and this {is} the gate of heaven.
<WEB Genesis 28.18>  And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put {for} his pillows, and set it up {for} a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.
<WEB Genesis 28.19>  And he called the name of that place Beth-el. but the name of that city {was called} Luz at the first.
<WEB Genesis 28.20>  And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
<WEB Genesis 28.21>  So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God.
<WEB Genesis 28.22>  And this stone, which I have set {for} a pillar, shall be God's house. and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth to thee.
<WEB Genesis 29.1>  Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
<WEB Genesis 29.2>  And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and lo, there {were} three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. and a great stone {was} upon the well's mouth.
<WEB Genesis 29.3>  And thither were all the flocks gathered. and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.
<WEB Genesis 29.4>  And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence {are} ye? And they said, We {are} from Haran.
<WEB Genesis 29.5>  And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? and they said, We know {him}.
<WEB Genesis 29.6>  And he said to them, {Is} he well? And they said, {He is} well. and behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
<WEB Genesis 29.7>  And he said, Lo, {it is} yet high day, neither {is it} time that the cattle should be collected. water ye the sheep, and go {and} feed {them}.
<WEB Genesis 29.8>  And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks are collected, and {till} they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
<WEB Genesis 29.9>  And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep. for she kept them.
<WEB Genesis 29.10>  And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother; that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
<WEB Genesis 29.11>  And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
<WEB Genesis 29.12>  And Jacob told Rachel that he {was} her father's brother, and that he {was} Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.
<WEB Genesis 29.13>  And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
<WEB Genesis 29.14>  And Laban said to him, Surely thou {art} my bone and my flesh. and he abode with him the space of a month.
<WEB Genesis 29.15>  And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou {art} my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what {shall} thy wages {be}?
<WEB Genesis 29.16>  And Laban had two daughters. the name of the elder {was} Leah, and the name of the younger {was} Rachel.
<WEB Genesis 29.17>  Leah {was} tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.
<WEB Genesis 29.18>  And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
<WEB Genesis 29.19>  And Laban said, {It is} better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. abide with me.
<WEB Genesis 29.20>  And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him {but} a few days, for the love he had to her.
<WEB Genesis 29.21>  And Jacob said to Laban, Give {me} my wife (for my days are fulfilled) that I may go in to her.
<WEB Genesis 29.22>  And Laban assembled all the men of the place, and made a feast.
<WEB Genesis 29.23>  And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.
<WEB Genesis 29.24>  And Laban gave to his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid {for} a handmaid.
<WEB Genesis 29.25>  And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it {was} Leah. and he said to Laban, What {is} this thou hast done to me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? why then hast thou deceived me?
<WEB Genesis 29.26>  And Laban said, it must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.
<WEB Genesis 29.27>  Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
<WEB Genesis 29.28>  And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. and he gave him Rachel, his daughter, for a wife also.
<WEB Genesis 29.29>  And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.
<WEB Genesis 29.30>  And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
<WEB Genesis 29.31>  And when the LORD saw that Leah {was} hated, he made her fruitful. but Rachel {was} barren.
<WEB Genesis 29.32>  And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben. for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
<WEB Genesis 29.33>  And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I {was} hated, he hath therefore given me this {son} also. and she called his name Simeon.
<WEB Genesis 29.34>  And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband adhere to me, because I have borne him three sons. therefore was his name called Levi.
<WEB Genesis 29.35>  And she conceived again, and bore a son. and she said, Now will I praise the LORD. therefore she called his name Judah, and left bearing.
<WEB Genesis 30.1>  And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
<WEB Genesis 30.2>  And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, {Am} I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
<WEB Genesis 30.3>  And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
<WEB Genesis 30.4>  And she gave him Bilhah, her handmaid, for a wife. and Jacob went in to her.
<WEB Genesis 30.5>  And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
<WEB Genesis 30.6>  And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son. therefore she called his name Dan.
<WEB Genesis 30.7>  And Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.
<WEB Genesis 30.8>  And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. and she called his name Naphtali.
<WEB Genesis 30.9>  When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah, her maid, and gave her Jacob for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 30.10>  And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a son.
<WEB Genesis 30.11>  And Leah said, A troop cometh. and she called his name Gad.
<WEB Genesis 30.12>  And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a second son.
<WEB Genesis 30.13>  And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed. and she called his name Asher.
<WEB Genesis 30.14>  And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
<WEB Genesis 30.15>  And she said to her, {Is it} a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.
<WEB Genesis 30.16>  And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
<WEB Genesis 30.17>  And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.
<WEB Genesis 30.18>  And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband. and she called his name Issachar.
<WEB Genesis 30.19>  And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.
<WEB Genesis 30.20>  And Leah said, God hath endowed me {with} a good dower; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. and she called his name Zebulun.
<WEB Genesis 30.21>  And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
<WEB Genesis 30.22>  And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and rendered her fruitful.
<WEB Genesis 30.23>  And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach.
<WEB Genesis 30.24>  And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD will add to me another son.
<WEB Genesis 30.25>  And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
<WEB Genesis 30.26>  Give {me} my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go. for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
<WEB Genesis 30.27>  And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, {tarry. for} I have learned by experience, that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
<WEB Genesis 30.28>  And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give {it}.
<WEB Genesis 30.29>  And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me.
<WEB Genesis 30.30>  For {it was} little which thou hadst before I {came}, and it is {now} increased to a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my coming. and now when shall I provide for my own house also?
<WEB Genesis 30.31>  And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed {and} keep thy flock.
<WEB Genesis 30.32>  I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. and {of such} shall be my hire.
<WEB Genesis 30.33>  So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face. every one that {is} not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me.
<WEB Genesis 30.34>  And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
<WEB Genesis 30.35>  And he removed that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted; every one that had {some} white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave {them} into the hands of his sons.
<WEB Genesis 30.36>  And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob. and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
<WEB Genesis 30.37>  And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which {was} in the rods.
<WEB Genesis 30.38>  And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
<WEB Genesis 30.39>  And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.
<WEB Genesis 30.40>  And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban. and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's cattle.
<WEB Genesis 30.41>  And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
<WEB Genesis 30.42>  But when the cattle were feeble, he put {them} not in. so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
<WEB Genesis 30.43>  And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.
<WEB Genesis 31.1>  And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that {was} our father's; and of {that} which {was} our father's hath he obtained all this glory.
<WEB Genesis 31.2>  And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it {was} not towards him as before.
<WEB Genesis 31.3>  And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
<WEB Genesis 31.4>  And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field to his flock,
<WEB Genesis 31.5>  And said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it {is} not towards me as before. but the God of my father hath been with me.
<WEB Genesis 31.6>  And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
<WEB Genesis 31.7>  And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times. but God suffered him not to hurt me.
<WEB Genesis 31.8>  If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bore speckled. and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then all the cattle bore ring-streaked.
<WEB Genesis 31.9>  Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given {them} to me.
<WEB Genesis 31.10>  And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle {were} ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
<WEB Genesis 31.11>  And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, {saying}, Jacob. And I said, Here {am} I.
<WEB Genesis 31.12>  And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle {are} ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled. for I have seen all that Laban doeth to thee.
<WEB Genesis 31.13>  I {am} the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, {and} where thou vowedst to me a vow. now arise, depart from this land, and return to the land of thy kindred.
<WEB Genesis 31.14>  And Rachel and Leah answered, and said to him, {Is there} yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
<WEB Genesis 31.15>  Are we not counted by him strangers; for he hath sold us, and hath quite consumed also our money.
<WEB Genesis 31.16>  For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that {is} ours, and our children's. now then whatever God hath said to thee, do.
<WEB Genesis 31.17>  Then Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
<WEB Genesis 31.18>  And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gained, the cattle of his getting, which he had gained in Padan-aram; to go to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 31.19>  And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images that {were} her father's.
<WEB Genesis 31.20>  And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he was about to depart.
<WEB Genesis 31.21>  So he fled with all that he had; and he arose, and passed over the river, and set his face {towards} the mount Gilead.
<WEB Genesis 31.22>  And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
<WEB Genesis 31.23>  And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey. and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
<WEB Genesis 31.24>  And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
<WEB Genesis 31.25>  Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount. and Laban, with his brethren, pitched in the mount of Gilead.
<WEB Genesis 31.26>  And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives {taken} with the sword?
<WEB Genesis 31.27>  Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
<WEB Genesis 31.28>  And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons, and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in {so} doing.
<WEB Genesis 31.29>  It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt. but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
<WEB Genesis 31.30>  And now, {though} thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou didst earnestly long after thy father's house; {yet} why hast thou stolen my gods?
<WEB Genesis 31.31>  And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid. for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
<WEB Genesis 31.32>  With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live. before our brethren discern thou what {is} thine with me, and take {it} to thee. for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
<WEB Genesis 31.33>  And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maid-servants' tents; but he found {them} not. Then he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
<WEB Genesis 31.34>  Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found {them} not.
<WEB Genesis 31.35>  And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women {is} upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
<WEB Genesis 31.36>  And Jacob was wroth, and chid with Laban. and Jacob answered, and said to Laban, What {is} my trespass? what {is} my sin, that thou hast so eagerly pursued after me?
<WEB Genesis 31.37>  Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household-stuff? set {it} here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
<WEB Genesis 31.38>  These twenty years {have} I {been} with thee. thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
<WEB Genesis 31.39>  That which was torn by beasts, I brought not to thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, {whether} stolen by day, or stolen by night.
<WEB Genesis 31.40>  {Thus} I was; in the day the drouth consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.
<WEB Genesis 31.41>  Thus have I been twenty years in thy house. I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle. and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
<WEB Genesis 31.42>  Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked {thee} yesternight.
<WEB Genesis 31.43>  And Laban answered, and said to Jacob, {These} daughters {are} my daughters, and {these} children {are} my children, and {these} cattle {are} my cattle, and all that thou seest {is} mine; and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have borne?
<WEB Genesis 31.44>  Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
<WEB Genesis 31.45>  And Jacob took a stone, and set it up {for} a pillar.
<WEB Genesis 31.46>  And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap. and they ate there upon the heap.
<WEB Genesis 31.47>  And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha. but Jacob called it Galeed.
<WEB Genesis 31.48>  And Laban said, This heap {is} a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed.
<WEB Genesis 31.49>  And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
<WEB Genesis 31.50>  If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take {other} wives besides my daughters; no man {is} with us; See, God {is} witness betwixt me and thee.
<WEB Genesis 31.51>  And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold {this} pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
<WEB Genesis 31.52>  This heap {be} witness, and {this} pillar {be} witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
<WEB Genesis 31.53>  The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 31.54>  Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread. and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
<WEB Genesis 31.55>  And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. and Laban departed, and returned to his place.
<WEB Genesis 32.1>  And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
<WEB Genesis 32.2>  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This {is} God's host. and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
<WEB Genesis 32.3>  And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
<WEB Genesis 32.4>  And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau. Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now.
<WEB Genesis 32.5>  And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants. and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
<WEB Genesis 32.6>  And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
<WEB Genesis 32.7>  Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and distressed. and he divided the people that {were} with him, and the flocks, and herds, and camels, into two bands;
<WEB Genesis 32.8>  And said, If Esau shall come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left, will escape.
<WEB Genesis 32.9>  And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee;
<WEB Genesis 32.10>  I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant. for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.
<WEB Genesis 32.11>  Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau. for I fear him, lest he shall come and smite me, {and} the mother with the children.
<WEB Genesis 32.12>  And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
<WEB Genesis 32.13>  And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau, his brother;
<WEB Genesis 32.14>  Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
<WEB Genesis 32.15>  Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
<WEB Genesis 32.16>  And he delivered {them} into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
<WEB Genesis 32.17>  And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose {art} thou? and whither goest thou? and whose {are} these before thee?
<WEB Genesis 32.18>  Then thou shalt say, They {are} thy servant Jacob's. it {is} a present sent to my lord Esau. and behold also he {is} behind us.
<WEB Genesis 32.19>  And so he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this manner shall ye speak to Esau, when ye find him.
<WEB Genesis 32.20>  And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob {is} behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
<WEB Genesis 32.21>  So the present went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the company.
<WEB Genesis 32.22>  And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
<WEB Genesis 32.23>  And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had.
<WEB Genesis 32.24>  And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him, until the breaking of the day.
<WEB Genesis 32.25>  And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh. and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
<WEB Genesis 32.26>  And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh; And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
<WEB Genesis 32.27>  And he said to him, What {is} thy name? And he said, Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 32.28>  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel. for as a prince hast thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed.
<WEB Genesis 32.29>  And Jacob asked {him}, and said, Tell {me}, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, why {is} it {that} thou dost ask after my name? and he blessed him there.
<WEB Genesis 32.30>  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel. for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
<WEB Genesis 32.31>  And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
<WEB Genesis 32.32>  Therefore the children of Israel eat not {of} the sinew which shrunk, which {is} upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrunk.
<WEB Genesis 33.1>  And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.
<WEB Genesis 33.2>  And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
<WEB Genesis 33.3>  And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother.
<WEB Genesis 33.4>  And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. and they wept.
<WEB Genesis 33.5>  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who {are} those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given to thy servant.
<WEB Genesis 33.6>  Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
<WEB Genesis 33.7>  And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
<WEB Genesis 33.8>  And he said, What {meanest} thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, {these are} to find grace in the sight of my lord.
<WEB Genesis 33.9>  And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself.
<WEB Genesis 33.10>  And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand. for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me.
<WEB Genesis 33.11>  Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. and he urged him, and he took {it}.
<WEB Genesis 33.12>  And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
<WEB Genesis 33.13>  And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children {are} tender, and the flocks and herds with young {are} with me, and if men should over-drive them one day, all the flock will die.
<WEB Genesis 33.14>  Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant. and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me, and the children are able to endure; until I come to my lord to Seir.
<WEB Genesis 33.15>  And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee {some} of the people that {are} with me. And he said, What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
<WEB Genesis 33.16>  So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
<WEB Genesis 33.17>  And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle. therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
<WEB Genesis 33.18>  And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which {is} in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.
<WEB Genesis 33.19>  And he bought a part of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.
<WEB Genesis 33.20>  And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.
<WEB Genesis 34.1>  And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
<WEB Genesis 34.2>  And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
<WEB Genesis 34.3>  And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.
<WEB Genesis 34.4>  And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 34.5>  And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the field.) and Jacob held his peace till they had come.
<WEB Genesis 34.6>  And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.
<WEB Genesis 34.7>  And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard {it}. and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
<WEB Genesis 34.8>  And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter. I pray you give her to him for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 34.9>  And make ye marriages with us. give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.
<WEB Genesis 34.10>  And ye shall dwell with us. and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
<WEB Genesis 34.11>  And Shechem said to her father, and to her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me, I will give.
<WEB Genesis 34.12>  Ask me never so much dower and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me. but give me the damsel for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 34.13>  And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, (because he had defiled Dinah their sister,)
<WEB Genesis 34.14>  And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised. for that {would be} a reproach to us.
<WEB Genesis 34.15>  But in this will we consent to you. If ye will be as we {are}, that every male of you shall be circumcised;
<WEB Genesis 34.16>  Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
<WEB Genesis 34.17>  But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
<WEB Genesis 34.18>  And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
<WEB Genesis 34.19>  And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter. and he {was} more honorable than all the house of his father.
<WEB Genesis 34.20>  And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
<WEB Genesis 34.21>  These men {are} peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein. for the land, behold, {it is} large enough for them. let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
<WEB Genesis 34.22>  Only herein, will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us shall be circumcised, as they {are} circumcised.
<WEB Genesis 34.23>  {Will} not their cattle, and their substance, and every beast of theirs {be} ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
<WEB Genesis 34.24>  And to Hamor and to Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city. and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
<WEB Genesis 34.25>  And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
<WEB Genesis 34.26>  And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
<WEB Genesis 34.27>  The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city; because they had defiled their sister.
<WEB Genesis 34.28>  They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which {was} in the city, and that which {was} in the field.
<WEB Genesis 34.29>  And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled even all that {was} in the house.
<WEB Genesis 34.30>  And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites, and the Perizzites. and I {being} few in number, they will assemble themselves against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
<WEB Genesis 34.31>  And they said, Should he deal with our sister, as with a harlot?
<WEB Genesis 35.1>  And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there. and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
<WEB Genesis 35.2>  Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that {were} with him, Put away the strange gods that {are} among you, and be clean, and change your garments.
<WEB Genesis 35.3>  And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
<WEB Genesis 35.4>  And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which {were} in their hand, and {the} ear-rings which {were} in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which {was} by Shechem.
<WEB Genesis 35.5>  And they journeyed. and the terror of God was on the cities that {were} round them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 35.6>  So Jacob came to Luz, which {is} in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-el) he and all the people that {were} with him.
<WEB Genesis 35.7>  And he erected there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
<WEB Genesis 35.8>  But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el, under an oak. and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.
<WEB Genesis 35.9>  And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram; and blessed him.
<WEB Genesis 35.10>  And God said to him, Thy name {is} Jacob. thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel.
<WEB Genesis 35.11>  And God said to him, I {am} God Almighty. be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.
<WEB Genesis 35.12>  And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
<WEB Genesis 35.13>  And God went up from him, in the place where he talked with him.
<WEB Genesis 35.14>  And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, {even} a pillar of stone. and he poured a drink-offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
<WEB Genesis 35.15>  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el.
<WEB Genesis 35.16>  And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath. and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
<WEB Genesis 35.17>  And it came to pass when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
<WEB Genesis 35.18>  And it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni. but his father called him Benjamin.
<WEB Genesis 35.19>  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which {is} Beth-lehem.
<WEB Genesis 35.20>  And Jacob set a pillar on her grave. that {is} the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
<WEB Genesis 35.21>  And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
<WEB Genesis 35.22>  And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. and Israel heard {it}. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
<WEB Genesis 35.23>  The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.
<WEB Genesis 35.24>  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin.
<WEB Genesis 35.25>  And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali.
<WEB Genesis 35.26>  And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher. These {are} the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padan-aram.
<WEB Genesis 35.27>  And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah (which {is} Hebron) where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
<WEB Genesis 35.28>  And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
<WEB Genesis 35.29>  And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, {being} old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
<WEB Genesis 36.1>  Now these {are} the generations of Esau, who {is} Edom.
<WEB Genesis 36.2>  Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
<WEB Genesis 36.3>  And Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
<WEB Genesis 36.4>  And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;
<WEB Genesis 36.5>  And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. These {are} the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 36.6>  And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 36.7>  For their riches were more than that they might dwell together. and the land wherein they were strangers could not sustain them, because of their cattle.
<WEB Genesis 36.8>  Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir. Esau {is} Edom.
<WEB Genesis 36.9>  And these {are} the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites, in mount Seir.
<WEB Genesis 36.10>  These {are} the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.
<WEB Genesis 36.11>  And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
<WEB Genesis 36.12>  And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. these {were} the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
<WEB Genesis 36.13>  And these {are} the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
<WEB Genesis 36.14>  And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon Esau's wife. and she bore to Esau, Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.
<WEB Genesis 36.15>  These {were} dukes of the sons of Esau. the sons of Eliphaz the first-born {son} of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,
<WEB Genesis 36.16>  Duke Korah, duke Gatam, {and} duke Amalek. these {are} the dukes, {descendants} of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom. these {were} the sons of Adah.
<WEB Genesis 36.17>  And these {are} the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah. these {are} the dukes, {descendants} of Reuel, in the land of Edom. these {are} the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
<WEB Genesis 36.18>  And these {are} the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah. these {were} the dukes, {descendants} of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah Esau's wife.
<WEB Genesis 36.19>  These {are} the sons of Esau (who {is} Edom) and these {are} their dukes.
<WEB Genesis 36.20>  These {are} the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah.
<WEB Genesis 36.21>  And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan. these {are} the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
<WEB Genesis 36.22>  And the children of Lotan were Hori, and Heman. and Lotan's sister {was} Timna.
<WEB Genesis 36.23>  And the children of Shobal {were} these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
<WEB Genesis 36.24>  And these {are} the children of Zibeon; both Ajah and Anah; this {was that} Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
<WEB Genesis 36.25>  And the children of Anah {were} these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
<WEB Genesis 36.26>  And these {are} the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.
<WEB Genesis 36.27>  The children of Ezer {are} these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Achan.
<WEB Genesis 36.28>  The children of Dishan {are} these; Uz, and Aran.
<WEB Genesis 36.29>  These {are} the dukes, {descendants} of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,
<WEB Genesis 36.30>  Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan; these {are} the dukes, {descendants} of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.
<WEB Genesis 36.31>  And these {are} the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
<WEB Genesis 36.32>  And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom. and the name of his city {was} Dinhabah.
<WEB Genesis 36.33>  And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.34>  And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.35>  And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead. and the name of his city {was} Avith.
<WEB Genesis 36.36>  And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.37>  And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth {by} the river reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.38>  And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
<WEB Genesis 36.39>  And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city {was} Pau; and his wife's name {was} Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
<WEB Genesis 36.40>  And these {are} the names of the dukes, {descendants} of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,
<WEB Genesis 36.41>  Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
<WEB Genesis 36.42>  Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar.
<WEB Genesis 36.43>  Duke Magdiel, duke Iram; these {are} the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the land of their possession. he {is} Esau the father of the Edomites.
<WEB Genesis 37.1>  And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 37.2>  These {are} the generations of Jacob. Joseph {being} seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad {was} with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.
<WEB Genesis 37.3>  Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he {was} the son of his old age. and he made him a coat of {many} colors.
<WEB Genesis 37.4>  And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
<WEB Genesis 37.5>  And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told {it} to his brethren. and they hated him yet the more.
<WEB Genesis 37.6>  And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed.
<WEB Genesis 37.7>  For behold, we {were} binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood around and made obeisance to my sheaf.
<WEB Genesis 37.8>  And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.
<WEB Genesis 37.9>  And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more. and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
<WEB Genesis 37.10>  And he told {it} to his father, and to his brethren. and his father rebuked him, and said to him, what {is} this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
<WEB Genesis 37.11>  And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
<WEB Genesis 37.12>  And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
<WEB Genesis 37.13>  And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed {the flock} in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here {am I}.
<WEB Genesis 37.14>  And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
<WEB Genesis 37.15>  And a certain man found him, and behold {he was} wandering in the field. and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
<WEB Genesis 37.16>  And he said, I seek my brethren. tell me, I pray thee, where they feed {their flocks}.
<WEB Genesis 37.17>  And the man said, They have departed hence. for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.
<WEB Genesis 37.18>  And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.
<WEB Genesis 37.19>  And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer is coming.
<WEB Genesis 37.20>  Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit; and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
<WEB Genesis 37.21>  And Reuben heard {it}, and he delivered him from their hands. and said, Let us not kill him.
<WEB Genesis 37.22>  And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that {is} in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might deliver him from their hands, to bring him back to his father.
<WEB Genesis 37.23>  And it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, {his} coat of {many} colors that {was} on him.
<WEB Genesis 37.24>  And they took him, and cast him into a pit. and the pit {was} empty; {there was} no water in it.
<WEB Genesis 37.25>  And they sat down to eat bread. and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry {them} down to Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 37.26>  And Judah said to his brethren, What profit {is it} if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood.
<WEB Genesis 37.27>  Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he {is} our brother, our flesh. and his brethren were content.
<WEB Genesis 37.28>  Then there passed by Midianites, merchants; and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty {pieces} of silver. and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 37.29>  And Reuben returned to the pit; and behold, Joseph {was} not in the pit. and he rent his clothes.
<WEB Genesis 37.30>  And he returned to his brethren, and said, The child {is} not. and I, whither shall I go?
<WEB Genesis 37.31>  And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood.
<WEB Genesis 37.32>  And they sent the coat of {many} colors, and they brought {it} to their father; and said, This have we found. know now whether it {is} thy son's coat or not.
<WEB Genesis 37.33>  And he knew it, and said, {It is} my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him. Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
<WEB Genesis 37.34>  And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
<WEB Genesis 37.35>  And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
<WEB Genesis 37.36>  And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, {and} captain of the guard.
<WEB Genesis 38.1>  And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name {was} Hirah.
<WEB Genesis 38.2>  And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name {was} Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her.
<WEB Genesis 38.3>  And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er.
<WEB Genesis 38.4>  And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.
<WEB Genesis 38.5>  And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah. and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.
<WEB Genesis 38.6>  And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name {was} Tamar.
<WEB Genesis 38.7>  And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
<WEB Genesis 38.8>  And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
<WEB Genesis 38.9>  And Onan knew that the seed would not be his. and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he frustrated the purpose, lest he should give seed to his brother.
<WEB Genesis 38.10>  And the thing which he did displeased the LORD. wherefore he slew him also.
<WEB Genesis 38.11>  Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son shall be grown; (for he said, Lest perhaps he die also as his brethren {did}.) and Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
<WEB Genesis 38.12>  And in process of time, the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died. and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
<WEB Genesis 38.13>  And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath, to shear his sheep.
<WEB Genesis 38.14>  And she put off from her, her widow's garments, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which {is} by the way to Timnath. for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him for a wife.
<WEB Genesis 38.15>  When Judah saw her, he thought her {to be} a harlot; because she had covered her face.
<WEB Genesis 38.16>  And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me have access to thee; (for he knew not that she {was} his daughter-in-law.) and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayst have access to me?
<WEB Genesis 38.17>  And he said, I will send {thee} a kid from the flock. and she said, Wilt thou give {me} a pledge, till thou sendest {it}?
<WEB Genesis 38.18>  And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? and she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that {is} in thy hand. and he gave {them to} her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
<WEB Genesis 38.19>  And she arose and went her way and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
<WEB Genesis 38.20>  And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive {his} pledge from the woman's hand. but he found her not.
<WEB Genesis 38.21>  Then he asked the men of that place, saying, where {is} the harlot that {was} openly by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot in this {place}.
<WEB Genesis 38.22>  And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, {that} there was no harlot in this {place}.
<WEB Genesis 38.23>  And Judah said, Let her take {it} to her, lest we be shamed. behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
<WEB Genesis 38.24>  And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold she {is} with child by lewdness. and Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
<WEB Genesis 38.25>  When she {was} brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these {are}, am I with child. and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose {are} these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
<WEB Genesis 38.26>  And Judah acknowledged {them}, and said She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. and he knew her again no more.
<WEB Genesis 38.27>  And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins {were} in her womb.
<WEB Genesis 38.28>  And it came to pass when she travailed, that {the one} put out {his} hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
<WEB Genesis 38.29>  And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth? {this} breach {be} upon thee. therefore his name was called Pharez.
<WEB Genesis 38.30>  And afterwards came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zarah.
<WEB Genesis 39.1>  And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.
<WEB Genesis 39.2>  And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
<WEB Genesis 39.3>  And his master saw that the LORD {was} with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
<WEB Genesis 39.4>  And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him. and he made him overseer over his house, and all {that} he had he put into his hand.
<WEB Genesis 39.5>  And it came to pass from the time {that} he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field.
<WEB Genesis 39.6>  And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the bread which he ate; and Joseph was {a} goodly {person}, and well favored.
<WEB Genesis 39.7>  And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph. and she said, Lie with me.
<WEB Genesis 39.8>  But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what {is} with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand.
<WEB Genesis 39.9>  {There is} none greater in his house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou {art} his wife. how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
<WEB Genesis 39.10>  And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not to her, to lie by her, {or} to be with her.
<WEB Genesis 39.11>  And it came to pass, about this time, that {Joseph} went into the house to do his business; and {there was} none of the men of the house there within.
<WEB Genesis 39.12>  And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went out.
<WEB Genesis 39.13>  And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled forth,
<WEB Genesis 39.14>  That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
<WEB Genesis 39.15>  And it came to pass, when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and went out.
<WEB Genesis 39.16>  And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.
<WEB Genesis 39.17>  And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought to us, came in to me to mock me.
<WEB Genesis 39.18>  And it came to pass, as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled.
<WEB Genesis 39.19>  And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
<WEB Genesis 39.20>  And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners {were} bound. and he was there in the prison.
<WEB Genesis 39.21>  But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
<WEB Genesis 39.22>  And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that {were} in the prison; and whatever they did there, was done by him.
<WEB Genesis 39.23>  The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing {that was} under his hand; because the LORD was with him. and {that} which he did the LORD made {it} to prosper.
<WEB Genesis 40.1>  And it came to pass after these things, {that} the butler of the king of Egypt and {his} baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 40.2>  And Pharaoh was wroth with two {of} his officers, with the chief of the butlers, and with the chief of the bakers.
<WEB Genesis 40.3>  And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph {was} bound.
<WEB Genesis 40.4>  And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in custody.
<WEB Genesis 40.5>  And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream; the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who {were} bound in the prison.
<WEB Genesis 40.6>  And Joseph came to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and behold, they {were} sad.
<WEB Genesis 40.7>  And he asked Pharaoh's officers that {were} with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Why look ye {so} sad to-day?
<WEB Genesis 40.8>  And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and {there is} no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, {Do} not interpretations {belong} to God? tell me {them}, I pray you.
<WEB Genesis 40.9>  And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine {was} before me;
<WEB Genesis 40.10>  And on the vine {were} three branches. and it {was} as though it budded, {and} its blossoms shot forth; and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.
<WEB Genesis 40.11>  And Pharaoh's cup {was} in my hand. and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
<WEB Genesis 40.12>  And Joseph said to him, This {is} the interpretation of it. The three branches {are} three days;
<WEB Genesis 40.13>  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place. and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
<WEB Genesis 40.14>  But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
<WEB Genesis 40.15>  For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews. and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
<WEB Genesis 40.16>  When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also {was} in my dream, and behold, {I had} three white baskets on my head.
<WEB Genesis 40.17>  And in the uppermost basket {there was} of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
<WEB Genesis 40.18>  And Joseph answered, and said, This {is} the interpretation of it. The three baskets {are} three days.
<WEB Genesis 40.19>  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
<WEB Genesis 40.20>  And it came to pass the third day, {which was} Pharaoh's birth-day, that he made a feast to all his servants. and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
<WEB Genesis 40.21>  And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
<WEB Genesis 40.22>  But he hanged the chief baker. as Joseph had interpreted to them.
<WEB Genesis 40.23>  Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
<WEB Genesis 41.1>  And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed. and behold, he stood by the river.
<WEB Genesis 41.2>  And behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored cows and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
<WEB Genesis 41.3>  And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the {other} cows upon the brink of the river.
<WEB Genesis 41.4>  And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
<WEB Genesis 41.5>  And he slept and dreamed the second time. and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
<WEB Genesis 41.6>  And behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
<WEB Genesis 41.7>  And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, {it was} a dream.
<WEB Genesis 41.8>  And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof. and Pharaoh told them his dream; but {there was} none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 41.9>  Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day.
<WEB Genesis 41.10>  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house, {both} me, and the chief baker.
<WEB Genesis 41.11>  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he. we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
<WEB Genesis 41.12>  And {there was} there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he interpreted.
<WEB Genesis 41.13>  And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was. me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.
<WEB Genesis 41.14>  Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. and he shaved {himself}, and changed his raiment, and came before Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 41.15>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and {there is} none that can interpret it. and I have heard it said of thee, {that} thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
<WEB Genesis 41.16>  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, {It is} not in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
<WEB Genesis 41.17>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river.
<WEB Genesis 41.18>  And behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed, and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow.
<WEB Genesis 41.19>  And behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor, and very ill-favored, and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.
<WEB Genesis 41.20>  And the lean and the ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
<WEB Genesis 41.21>  And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they {were} still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
<WEB Genesis 41.22>  And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good.
<WEB Genesis 41.23>  And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, {and} blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
<WEB Genesis 41.24>  And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. and I told {this} to the magicians; but {there was} none that could explain {it} to me.
<WEB Genesis 41.25>  And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh {is} one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he {is} about to do.
<WEB Genesis 41.26>  The seven good cows {are} seven years; and the seven good ears {are} seven years. the dream {is} one.
<WEB Genesis 41.27>  And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them {are} seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind will be seven years of famine.
<WEB Genesis 41.28>  This {is} the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. What God {is} about to do he showeth to Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 41.29>  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.30>  And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
<WEB Genesis 41.31>  And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following. for it {will be} very grievous.
<WEB Genesis 41.32>  And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; {it is} because the thing {is} established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
<WEB Genesis 41.33>  Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.34>  Let Pharaoh do {this}, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
<WEB Genesis 41.35>  And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh; and let them keep food in the cities.
<WEB Genesis 41.36>  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine.
<WEB Genesis 41.37>  And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
<WEB Genesis 41.38>  And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find {such a man} as this {is}, a man in whom the spirit of God {is}?
<WEB Genesis 41.39>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, {there is} none so discreet and wise as thou {art}.
<WEB Genesis 41.40>  Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled. only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
<WEB Genesis 41.41>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.42>  And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
<WEB Genesis 41.43>  And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. and they cried before him, Bow the knee. and he made him {ruler} over all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.44>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I {am} Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.45>  And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. and Joseph went over {all} the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.46>  And Joseph {was} thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.47>  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfulls.
<WEB Genesis 41.48>  And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. the food of the field which {was} around every city, he laid up in the same.
<WEB Genesis 41.49>  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for {it was} without number.
<WEB Genesis 41.50>  And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came. which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
<WEB Genesis 41.51>  And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh. For God, {said he}, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
<WEB Genesis 41.52>  And the name of the second called he Ephraim. for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
<WEB Genesis 41.53>  And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
<WEB Genesis 41.54>  And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said. and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
<WEB Genesis 41.55>  And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
<WEB Genesis 41.56>  And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 41.57>  And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy {corn}; because the famine was distressing in all lands.
<WEB Genesis 42.1>  Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
<WEB Genesis 42.2>  And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt. go down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
<WEB Genesis 42.3>  And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 42.4>  But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren. for he said, Lest perhaps mischief shall befall him.
<WEB Genesis 42.5>  And the sons of Israel came to buy {corn} among those that came. for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 42.6>  And Joseph {was} the governor over the land, {and} he {it was} that sold to all the people of the land. and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed themselves before him {with} their faces to the earth.
<WEB Genesis 42.7>  And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
<WEB Genesis 42.8>  And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
<WEB Genesis 42.9>  And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye {are} spies; to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.
<WEB Genesis 42.10>  And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come.
<WEB Genesis 42.11>  We {are} all one man's sons; we {are} true {men}; thy servants are no spies.
<WEB Genesis 42.12>  And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.
<WEB Genesis 42.13>  And they said, Thy servants {are} twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest {is} this day with our father, and one {is} not.
<WEB Genesis 42.14>  And Joseph said to them, That {is} what I spoke to you, saying, Ye {are} spies.
<WEB Genesis 42.15>  By this ye shall be proved. By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother shall come hither.
<WEB Genesis 42.16>  Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether {there is any} truth in you. or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye {are} spies.
<WEB Genesis 42.17>  And he put them all together into custody three days.
<WEB Genesis 42.18>  And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; {for} I fear God.
<WEB Genesis 42.19>  If ye {are} true {men}, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison. go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses.
<WEB Genesis 42.20>  But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
<WEB Genesis 42.21>  And they said one to another, We {are} verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
<WEB Genesis 42.22>  And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the young man; and ye would not hear? therefore behold also his blood is required.
<WEB Genesis 42.23>  And they knew not that Joseph understood {them}; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.
<WEB Genesis 42.24>  And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
<WEB Genesis 42.25>  Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way. and thus did he to them.
<WEB Genesis 42.26>  And they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
<WEB Genesis 42.27>  And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money. for behold, it {was} in his sack's mouth.
<WEB Genesis 42.28>  And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and see {it is} even in my sack. and their heart failed {them}, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What {is} this {that} God hath done to us?
<WEB Genesis 42.29>  And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them, saying,
<WEB Genesis 42.30>  The man {who is} the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
<WEB Genesis 42.31>  And we said to him, We {are} true {men}; we are no spies.
<WEB Genesis 42.32>  We {are} twelve brethren, sons of our father. one {is} not, and the youngest {is} this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
<WEB Genesis 42.33>  And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this shall I know that ye {are} true {men}. leave one of your brethren {here} with me, and take {food for} the famine of your households, and depart.
<WEB Genesis 42.34>  And bring your youngest brother to me. then shall I know that ye {are} no spies, but {that} ye {are} true {men}. then will I deliver to you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
<WEB Genesis 42.35>  And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money {was} in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
<WEB Genesis 42.36>  And Jacob their father said to them, Me have ye bereaved. Joseph {is} not, and Simeon {is} not, and ye will take Benjamin {away}. all these things are against me.
<WEB Genesis 42.37>  And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee. deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
<WEB Genesis 42.38>  And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. if mischief shall befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
<WEB Genesis 43.1>  And the famine {was} severe in the land.
<WEB Genesis 43.2>  And it came to pass, when they had consumed the corn which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.
<WEB Genesis 43.3>  And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother {be} with you.
<WEB Genesis 43.4>  If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food.
<WEB Genesis 43.5>  But if thou wilt not send {him}, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother {be} with you.
<WEB Genesis 43.6>  And Israel said, Why dealt ye {so} ill with me, {as} to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
<WEB Genesis 43.7>  And they said, The man asked us strictly concerning our state, and our kindred, saying, {Is} your father yet alive? have ye {another} brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
<WEB Genesis 43.8>  And Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, {and} also our little ones.
<WEB Genesis 43.9>  I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him. if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.
<WEB Genesis 43.10>  For except we had delayed, surely now we had returned this second time.
<WEB Genesis 43.11>  And their father Israel said to them, If {it must be} so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds.
<WEB Genesis 43.12>  And take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry {it} again in your hand; it may be it {was} an oversight.
<WEB Genesis 43.13>  Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man.
<WEB Genesis 43.14>  And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved, I am bereaved.
<WEB Genesis 43.15>  And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and arose, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
<WEB Genesis 43.16>  And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring {these} men home, and slay, and make ready. for {these} men shall dine with me at noon.
<WEB Genesis 43.17>  And the man did as Joseph commanded. and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
<WEB Genesis 43.18>  And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bond-men, and our asses.
<WEB Genesis 43.19>  And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
<WEB Genesis 43.20>  And said, O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food.
<WEB Genesis 43.21>  And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, {every} man's money {was} in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. and we have brought it again in our hand.
<WEB Genesis 43.22>  And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food. we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
<WEB Genesis 43.23>  And he said, Peace {be} to you, fear not. your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.
<WEB Genesis 43.24>  And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave {them} water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
<WEB Genesis 43.25>  And they made ready the present against Joseph should come at noon. for they heard that they should eat bread there.
<WEB Genesis 43.26>  And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which {was} in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
<WEB Genesis 43.27>  And he asked them of {their} welfare, and said, {Is} your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? {Is} he yet alive?
<WEB Genesis 43.28>  And they answered, Thy servant, our father, {is} in good health, he {is} yet alive. and they bowed their heads and made obeisance.
<WEB Genesis 43.29>  And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, {Is} this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.
<WEB Genesis 43.30>  And Joseph made haste; for his bowels yearned towards his brother. and he sought {where} to weep; and he entered into {his} chamber, and wept there.
<WEB Genesis 43.31>  And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
<WEB Genesis 43.32>  And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that {is} an abomination to the Egyptians.
<WEB Genesis 43.33>  And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right, and the youngest according to his youth. and the men wondered one at another.
<WEB Genesis 43.34>  And he took {and sent} messes to them from before him. but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
<WEB Genesis 44.1>  And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks {with} food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
<WEB Genesis 44.2>  And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
<WEB Genesis 44.3>  As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they, and their asses.
<WEB Genesis 44.4>  {And} when they had gone out of the city, {and} were not {yet} far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
<WEB Genesis 44.5>  {Is} not this {the cup} in which my lord drinketh, and by which indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
<WEB Genesis 44.6>  And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.
<WEB Genesis 44.7>  And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing.
<WEB Genesis 44.8>  Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan. how then should we steal from thy lord's house silver or gold?
<WEB Genesis 44.9>  With whom {soever} of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bond-men.
<WEB Genesis 44.10>  And he said, Now also {let} it {be} according to your words. he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
<WEB Genesis 44.11>  Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
<WEB Genesis 44.12>  And he searched, {and} began at the eldest, and left at the youngest. and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
<WEB Genesis 44.13>  Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
<WEB Genesis 44.14>  And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, (for he {was} yet there.) and they fell before him on the ground.
<WEB Genesis 44.15>  And Joseph said to them, What deed {is} this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
<WEB Genesis 44.16>  And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants. behold we {are} my lord's servants, both we, and {he} also with whom the cup is found.
<WEB Genesis 44.17>  And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so. the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father.
<WEB Genesis 44.18>  Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou {art} even as Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 44.19>  My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
<WEB Genesis 44.20>  And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one. and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
<WEB Genesis 44.21>  And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.
<WEB Genesis 44.22>  And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for {if} he should leave his father, {his father} would die.
<WEB Genesis 44.23>  And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
<WEB Genesis 44.24>  And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.
<WEB Genesis 44.25>  And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food.
<WEB Genesis 44.26>  And we said, We cannot go down. if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother shall {be} with us.
<WEB Genesis 44.27>  And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two {sons}.
<WEB Genesis 44.28>  And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since.
<WEB Genesis 44.29>  And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
<WEB Genesis 44.30>  Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life)
<WEB Genesis 44.31>  It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad {is} not {with us}, that he will die. and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave.
<WEB Genesis 44.32>  For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever.
<WEB Genesis 44.33>  Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 44.34>  For how shall I return to my father, and the lad {be} not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father.
<WEB Genesis 45.1>  Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. and there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 45.2>  And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
<WEB Genesis 45.3>  And Joseph said to his brethren, I {am} Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
<WEB Genesis 45.4>  And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. and they came near. And he said, I {am} Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 45.5>  Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God sent me before you to preserve life.
<WEB Genesis 45.6>  For these two years {hath} the famine {been} in the land. and yet {there are} five years, in which {there shall} neither {be} tillage nor harvest.
<WEB Genesis 45.7>  And God sent me before you, to preserve for you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
<WEB Genesis 45.8>  So now {it was} not you {that} sent me hither, but God. and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 45.9>  Haste ye, and return to my father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; delay not.
<WEB Genesis 45.10>  And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast.
<WEB Genesis 45.11>  And there will I nourish thee, (for yet {there are} five years of famine,) lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, should come to poverty.
<WEB Genesis 45.12>  And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that {it is} my mouth that speaketh to you.
<WEB Genesis 45.13>  And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen. and ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither.
<WEB Genesis 45.14>  And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
<WEB Genesis 45.15>  Moreover, he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them. and after that his brethren talked with him.
<WEB Genesis 45.16>  And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come. and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
<WEB Genesis 45.17>  And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, return to the land of Canaan;
<WEB Genesis 45.18>  And take your father, and your households, and come to me. and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
<WEB Genesis 45.19>  Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
<WEB Genesis 45.20>  Also regard not your furniture; for the good of all the land of Egypt {is} yours.
<WEB Genesis 45.21>  And the children of Israel did so. and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
<WEB Genesis 45.22>  To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment. but to Benjamin he gave three hundred {pieces} of silver, and five changes of raiment.
<WEB Genesis 45.23>  And to his father he sent after this {manner}; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and meat, for his father by the way.
<WEB Genesis 45.24>  So he sent his brethren away, and they departed. and he said to them, See that ye contend not by the way.
<WEB Genesis 45.25>  And they went up from Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father,
<WEB Genesis 45.26>  And told him, saying, Joseph {is} yet alive, and he {is} governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
<WEB Genesis 45.27>  And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them. and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
<WEB Genesis 45.28>  And Israel said, {It is} enough; Joseph my son {is} yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.
<WEB Genesis 46.1>  And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
<WEB Genesis 46.2>  And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. and he said, Here {am} I.
<WEB Genesis 46.3>  And he said, I {am} God, the God of thy father. fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation.
<WEB Genesis 46.4>  I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up {again}. and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
<WEB Genesis 46.5>  And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba. and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
<WEB Genesis 46.6>  And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him.
<WEB Genesis 46.7>  His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 46.8>  And these {are} the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons. Reuben, Jacob's first-born.
<WEB Genesis 46.9>  And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
<WEB Genesis 46.10>  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
<WEB Genesis 46.11>  And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
<WEB Genesis 46.12>  And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah. but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron, and Hamul.
<WEB Genesis 46.13>  And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
<WEB Genesis 46.14>  And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
<WEB Genesis 46.15>  These {are} the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah. all the souls of his sons and his daughters {were} thirty and three.
<WEB Genesis 46.16>  And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggai, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
<WEB Genesis 46.17>  And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
<WEB Genesis 46.18>  These {are} the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. and these she bore to Jacob, {even} sixteen souls.
<WEB Genesis 46.19>  The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
<WEB Genesis 46.20>  And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
<WEB Genesis 46.21>  And the sons of Benjamin {were} Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
<WEB Genesis 46.22>  These {are} the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls {were} fourteen.
<WEB Genesis 46.23>  And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
<WEB Genesis 46.24>  And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
<WEB Genesis 46.25>  These {are} the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob. all the souls {were} seven.
<WEB Genesis 46.26>  All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls {were} sixty and six.
<WEB Genesis 46.27>  And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, {were} two souls. all the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, {were} seventy.
<WEB Genesis 46.28>  And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
<WEB Genesis 46.29>  And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went to meet Israel his father to Goshen; and presented himself to him. and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
<WEB Genesis 46.30>  And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou {art} yet alive.
<WEB Genesis 46.31>  And Joseph said to his brethren, and to his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren, and my father's house, who {were} in the land of Canaan are come to me.
<WEB Genesis 46.32>  And the men {are} shepherds, for their employment hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
<WEB Genesis 46.33>  And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What {is} your occupation?
<WEB Genesis 46.34>  That ye shall say, The occupation of thy servants hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, {and} also our fathers. that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd {is} an abomination to the Egyptians.
<WEB Genesis 47.1>  Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan; and behold, they {are} in the land of Goshen.
<WEB Genesis 47.2>  And he took some of his brethren, {even} five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 47.3>  And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What {is} your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants {are} shepherds, both we, {and} also our fathers.
<WEB Genesis 47.4>  They said moreover to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land. for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine {is} severe in the land of Canaan. now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
<WEB Genesis 47.5>  And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come to thee.
<WEB Genesis 47.6>  The land of Egypt {is} before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest {any} men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
<WEB Genesis 47.7>  And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 47.8>  And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old {art} thou?
<WEB Genesis 47.9>  And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage {are} a hundred and thirty years. few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, nor have they attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
<WEB Genesis 47.10>  And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
<WEB Genesis 47.11>  And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
<WEB Genesis 47.12>  And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread according to {their} families.
<WEB Genesis 47.13>  And {there was} no bread in all the land; for the famine {was} very distressing, so that the land of Egypt, and {all} the land of Canaan, fainted by reason of the famine.
<WEB Genesis 47.14>  And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought. and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
<WEB Genesis 47.15>  And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread. for why should we die in thy presence. for the money faileth.
<WEB Genesis 47.16>  And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money hath failed.
<WEB Genesis 47.17>  And they brought their cattle to Joseph. and Joseph gave them bread {in exchange} for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread, for all their cattle, for that year.
<WEB Genesis 47.18>  When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not aught left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands.
<WEB Genesis 47.19>  Why shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. and give {us} seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
<WEB Genesis 47.20>  And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them. so the land became Pharaoh's.
<WEB Genesis 47.21>  And as for the people, he removed them to cities from {one} end of the borders of Egypt even to the {other} end thereof.
<WEB Genesis 47.22>  Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion {assigned them} by Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. wherefore they sold not their lands.
<WEB Genesis 47.23>  Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. lo, {here is} seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
<WEB Genesis 47.24>  And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth {part} to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
<WEB Genesis 47.25>  And they said, Thou hast saved our lives. let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
<WEB Genesis 47.26>  And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, {that} Pharaoh should have the fifth {part}; except the land of the priests only, {which} became not Pharaoh's.
<WEB Genesis 47.27>  And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions in it and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
<WEB Genesis 47.28>  And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred and forty seven years.
<WEB Genesis 47.29>  And the time drew nigh that Israel must die. and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.
<WEB Genesis 47.30>  But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
<WEB Genesis 47.31>  And he said, Swear to me. and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
<WEB Genesis 48.1>  And it came to pass after these things, that {one} told Joseph, Behold, thy father {is} sick. and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
<WEB Genesis 48.2>  And {one} told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh to thee. and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
<WEB Genesis 48.3>  And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
<WEB Genesis 48.4>  And said to me, Behold I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee, {for} an everlasting possession.
<WEB Genesis 48.5>  And now, thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, {are} mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
<WEB Genesis 48.6>  And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, {and} shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
<WEB Genesis 48.7>  And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, when yet {there was} but a little way to come to Ephrath. and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same {is} Beth-lehem.
<WEB Genesis 48.8>  And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who {are} these?
<WEB Genesis 48.9>  And Joseph said to his father, They {are} my sons, whom God hath given me in this {place}. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them.
<WEB Genesis 48.10>  (Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, {so that} he could not see.) And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
<WEB Genesis 48.11>  And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face. and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.
<WEB Genesis 48.12>  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
<WEB Genesis 48.13>  And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel's right hand, and brought {them} near to him.
<WEB Genesis 48.14>  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid {it} upon Ephraim's head, who {was} the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands by design; for Manasseh {was} the first-born.
<WEB Genesis 48.15>  And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day,
<WEB Genesis 48.16>  The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
<WEB Genesis 48.17>  And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. and he lifted his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
<WEB Genesis 48.18>  And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this {is} the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
<WEB Genesis 48.19>  And his father refused, and said, I know {it}, my son, I know {it}; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
<WEB Genesis 48.20>  And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
<WEB Genesis 48.21>  And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
<WEB Genesis 48.22>  Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
<WEB Genesis 49.1>  And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Assemble yourselves, that I may tell you {that} which shall befall you in the last days.
<WEB Genesis 49.2>  Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob. and hearken to Israel your father.
<WEB Genesis 49.3>  Reuben, thou {art} my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power.
<WEB Genesis 49.4>  Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou {it}; he went up to my couch.
<WEB Genesis 49.5>  Simeon and Levi {are} brethren. instruments of cruelty {are in}, their habitations.
<WEB Genesis 49.6>  O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not thou united. for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.
<WEB Genesis 49.7>  Cursed {be} their anger, for {it was} fierce. and their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
<WEB Genesis 49.8>  Judah, thou {art he} whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand {shall be} on the neck of thy enemies. thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
<WEB Genesis 49.9>  Judah {is} a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou hast gone up. he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion. who shall rouse him up?
<WEB Genesis 49.10>  The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come. and to him {shall be} the gathering of the people.
<WEB Genesis 49.11>  Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes.
<WEB Genesis 49.12>  His eyes {shall be} red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
<WEB Genesis 49.13>  Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he {shall be} for a haven of ships; and his border {shall be} to Zidon.
<WEB Genesis 49.14>  Issachar {is} a strong ass, couching down between two burdens.
<WEB Genesis 49.15>  And he saw that rest {was} good, and the land that {it was} pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.
<WEB Genesis 49.16>  Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
<WEB Genesis 49.17>  Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
<WEB Genesis 49.18>  I have waited for thy salvation O LORD.
<WEB Genesis 49.19>  Gad, a troop shall overcome him. but he shall overcome at the last.
<WEB Genesis 49.20>  Out of Asher his bread {shall be} fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
<WEB Genesis 49.21>  Naphtali {is} a hind let loose. he giveth goodly words.
<WEB Genesis 49.22>  Joseph {is} a fruitful bough, {even} a fruitful bough by a well; {whose} branches run over the wall.
<WEB Genesis 49.23>  The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot {at him}, and hated him.
<WEB Genesis 49.24>  But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty {God} of Jacob. from thence {is} the shepherd the stone of Israel.
<WEB Genesis 49.25>  {Even} by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
<WEB Genesis 49.26>  The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
<WEB Genesis 49.27>  Benjamin shall raven {as} a wolf. in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
<WEB Genesis 49.28>  All these {are} the twelve tribes of Israel. and this {is it} which their father spoke to them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
<WEB Genesis 49.29>  And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people. bury me with my fathers in the cave that {is} in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
<WEB Genesis 49.30>  In the cave that {is} in the field of Machpelah, which {is} before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.
<WEB Genesis 49.31>  (There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah,)
<WEB Genesis 49.32>  The purchase of the field and of the cave that {is} in it, {was} from the children of Heth.
<WEB Genesis 49.33>  And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his people.
<WEB Genesis 50.1>  And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
<WEB Genesis 50.2>  And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. and the physicians embalmed Israel.
<WEB Genesis 50.3>  And forty days were fulfilled for him; (for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed.) and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
<WEB Genesis 50.4>  And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
<WEB Genesis 50.5>  My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die. in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
<WEB Genesis 50.6>  And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
<WEB Genesis 50.7>  And Joseph went up to bury his father. and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
<WEB Genesis 50.8>  And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house. only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.
<WEB Genesis 50.9>  And there went with him both chariots and horsemen. and it was a very great company.
<WEB Genesis 50.10>  And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which {is} beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation. and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
<WEB Genesis 50.11>  And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This {is} a grievous mourning to the Egyptians. wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which {is} beyond Jordan.
<WEB Genesis 50.12>  And his sons did to him according as he commanded them.
<WEB Genesis 50.13>  For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
<WEB Genesis 50.14>  And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
<WEB Genesis 50.15>  And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.
<WEB Genesis 50.16>  And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,
<WEB Genesis 50.17>  So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did to thee evil. and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
<WEB Genesis 50.18>  And his brethren also went and fell down before his face. and they said, Behold, we {are} thy servants.
<WEB Genesis 50.19>  And Joseph said to them, Fear not. for {am} I in the place of God?
<WEB Genesis 50.20>  But as for you, ye thought evil against me; {but} God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as {it is} this day, to save many people alive.
<WEB Genesis 50.21>  Now therefore fear ye not. I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
<WEB Genesis 50.22>  And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house. and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
<WEB Genesis 50.23>  And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third {generation}. the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
<WEB Genesis 50.24>  And Joseph said to his brethren, I die. and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
<WEB Genesis 50.25>  And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
<WEB Genesis 50.26>  So Joseph died, {being} a hundred and ten years old. and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
