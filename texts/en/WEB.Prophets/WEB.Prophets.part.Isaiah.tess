<WEB Isaiah 1.1>  The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, {and} Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<WEB Isaiah 1.2>  Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth. for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
<WEB Isaiah 1.3>  The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib. {but} Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
<WEB Isaiah 1.4>  Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that are corrupters. they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.
<WEB Isaiah 1.5>  Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more. the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
<WEB Isaiah 1.6>  From the sole of the foot even to the head {there is} no soundness in {it}; {but} wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores. they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
<WEB Isaiah 1.7>  Your country {is} desolate, your cities {are} burned with fire. your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and {it is} desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
<WEB Isaiah 1.8>  And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
<WEB Isaiah 1.9>  Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom; we should have been like Gomorrah.
<WEB Isaiah 1.10>  Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
<WEB Isaiah 1.11>  To what purpose {is} the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the LORD. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.
<WEB Isaiah 1.12>  When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
<WEB Isaiah 1.13>  Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; {it is} iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
<WEB Isaiah 1.14>  Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear {them}.
<WEB Isaiah 1.15>  And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. yes, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear. your hands are full of blood.
<WEB Isaiah 1.16>  Wash ye, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;
<WEB Isaiah 1.17>  Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
<WEB Isaiah 1.18>  Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD. though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow, though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
<WEB Isaiah 1.19>  If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 1.20>  But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword. for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 1.21>  How is the faithful city become a harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
<WEB Isaiah 1.22>  Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.
<WEB Isaiah 1.23>  Thy princes {are} rebellious, and companions of thieves. every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards. they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come to them.
<WEB Isaiah 1.24>  Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies.
<WEB Isaiah 1.25>  And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin.
<WEB Isaiah 1.26>  And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning. afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
<WEB Isaiah 1.27>  Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 1.28>  And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners {shall be} together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
<WEB Isaiah 1.29>  For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
<WEB Isaiah 1.30>  For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
<WEB Isaiah 1.31>  And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench {them}.
<WEB Isaiah 2.1>  The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 2.2>  And it shall come to pass in the last days, {that} the mount of the LORD'S house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.
<WEB Isaiah 2.3>  And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 2.4>  And he will judge among the nations, and will rebuke many people. and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<WEB Isaiah 2.5>  O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 2.6>  Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east, and {are} sooth-sayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
<WEB Isaiah 2.7>  Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither {is there any} end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither {is there any} end of their chariots.
<WEB Isaiah 2.8>  Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
<WEB Isaiah 2.9>  And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself. therefore forgive them not.
<WEB Isaiah 2.10>  Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.
<WEB Isaiah 2.11>  The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be abased, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<WEB Isaiah 2.12>  For the day of the LORD of hosts {shall be} upon every {one that is} proud and lofty, and upon every {one that is} lifted up; and he shall be brought low.
<WEB Isaiah 2.13>  And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, {that are} high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
<WEB Isaiah 2.14>  And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills {that are} lifted up,
<WEB Isaiah 2.15>  And upon every high tower, and upon every fortified wall,
<WEB Isaiah 2.16>  And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
<WEB Isaiah 2.17>  And the loftiness of man shall be abased, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low. and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<WEB Isaiah 2.18>  And the idols he will utterly abolish.
<WEB Isaiah 2.19>  And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 2.20>  In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made {each one} for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
<WEB Isaiah 2.21>  To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 2.22>  Cease ye from man, whose breath {is} in his nostrils. for wherein is he to be accounted of?
<WEB Isaiah 3.1>  For behold, the LORD, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the rod and the staff, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water,
<WEB Isaiah 3.2>  The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
<WEB Isaiah 3.3>  The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the skillful artificer, and the eloquent orator.
<WEB Isaiah 3.4>  And I will give children {to be} their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
<WEB Isaiah 3.5>  And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor. the child shall behave himself proudly against the elder, and the base against the honorable.
<WEB Isaiah 3.6>  When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, {saying}, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and {let} this ruin {be} under thy hand.
<WEB Isaiah 3.7>  In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house {is} neither bread nor clothing. make me not a ruler of the people.
<WEB Isaiah 3.8>  For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen. because their tongue and their doings {are} against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
<WEB Isaiah 3.9>  The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide {it} not. Woe to their soul! for they have rewarded evil to themselves.
<WEB Isaiah 3.10>  Say ye to the righteous, that {it shall be} well {with him}. for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
<WEB Isaiah 3.11>  Woe to the wicked! {it shall be} ill {with him}. for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
<WEB Isaiah 3.12>  {As for} my people, children {are} their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they who lead thee cause {thee} to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
<WEB Isaiah 3.13>  The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.
<WEB Isaiah 3.14>  The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and with their princes. for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor {is} in your houses.
<WEB Isaiah 3.15>  What mean ye {that} ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the LORD God of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 3.16>  Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with extended necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing {as} they go, and making a tinkling with their feet.
<WEB Isaiah 3.17>  Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will uncover their secret parts.
<WEB Isaiah 3.18>  In that day the LORD will take away the show of {their} tinkling ornaments {about their feet}, and {their} cauls, and {their} round tires like the moon.
<WEB Isaiah 3.19>  The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
<WEB Isaiah 3.20>  The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the head-bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings,
<WEB Isaiah 3.21>  The rings, and nose-jewels,
<WEB Isaiah 3.22>  The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins,
<WEB Isaiah 3.23>  The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
<WEB Isaiah 3.24>  And it shall come to pass, {that} instead of sweet smell there shall be an offensive odor; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; {and} burning instead of beauty.
<WEB Isaiah 3.25>  Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
<WEB Isaiah 3.26>  And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she {being} desolate, shall sit upon the ground.
<WEB Isaiah 4.1>  And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel. only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
<WEB Isaiah 4.2>  In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth {shall be} excellent and comely for them that have escaped of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 4.3>  And it shall come to pass, {that he that is} left in Zion, and {he that} remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, {even} every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 4.4>  When the LORD shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
<WEB Isaiah 4.5>  And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night. for upon all the glory {shall be} a defense.
<WEB Isaiah 4.6>  And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
<WEB Isaiah 5.1>  Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.
<WEB Isaiah 5.2>  And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine-press therein. and he expected that it would bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
<WEB Isaiah 5.3>  And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
<WEB Isaiah 5.4>  What more could have been done to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Why, when I expected that it would bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
<WEB Isaiah 5.5>  And now come; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; {and} break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down.
<WEB Isaiah 5.6>  And I will lay it waste. it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
<WEB Isaiah 5.7>  For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts {is} the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant. and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.
<WEB Isaiah 5.8>  Woe to them that join house to house, {that} lay field to field, till {there is} no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
<WEB Isaiah 5.9>  In my ears {said} the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, {even} great and fair, without inhabitant.
<WEB Isaiah 5.10>  Yes, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.
<WEB Isaiah 5.11>  Woe to them that rise early in the morning, {that} they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, {till} wine inflameth them!
<WEB Isaiah 5.12>  And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts. but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.
<WEB Isaiah 5.13>  Therefore my people have gone into captivity, because {they have} no knowledge. and their honorable men {are} famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
<WEB Isaiah 5.14>  Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure. and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
<WEB Isaiah 5.15>  And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be abased.
<WEB Isaiah 5.16>  But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 5.17>  Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
<WEB Isaiah 5.18>  Woe to them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart-rope.
<WEB Isaiah 5.19>  That say, Let him make speed, {and} hasten his work, that we may see {it}. and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know {it}!
<WEB Isaiah 5.20>  Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
<WEB Isaiah 5.21>  Woe to {them that are} wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
<WEB Isaiah 5.22>  Woe to {them that are} mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink.
<WEB Isaiah 5.23>  Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
<WEB Isaiah 5.24>  Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, {so} their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust. because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 5.25>  Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them. and the hills trembled, and their carcasses {were} torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 5.26>  And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar, and will hiss to them from the end of the earth. and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.
<WEB Isaiah 5.27>  None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken.
<WEB Isaiah 5.28>  Whose arrows {are} sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.
<WEB Isaiah 5.29>  Their roaring {shall be} like a lion, they shall roar like young lions. yes, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry {it} away safe, and none shall deliver {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 5.30>  And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea. and if {one} looketh to the land, behold darkness {and} sorrow, and the light is darkened in its heavens.
<WEB Isaiah 6.1>  In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and elevated, and his train filled the temple.
<WEB Isaiah 6.2>  Above it stood seraphim. each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
<WEB Isaiah 6.3>  And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy {is} the LORD of hosts. the whole earth {is} full of his glory.
<WEB Isaiah 6.4>  And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
<WEB Isaiah 6.5>  Then said I, Woe {is} me! for I am undone; because I {am} a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 6.6>  Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, {which} he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
<WEB Isaiah 6.7>  And he laid {it} upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thy iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
<WEB Isaiah 6.8>  Also I heard the voice of the LORD, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here {am} I; send me.
<WEB Isaiah 6.9>  And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
<WEB Isaiah 6.10>  Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
<WEB Isaiah 6.11>  Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities shall be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate;
<WEB Isaiah 6.12>  And the LORD shall have removed men far away, and {there be} a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 6.13>  But yet in it {shall be} a tenth, and {it} shall return, and shall be eaten. as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance {is} in them, when they cast {their leaves}. {so} the holy seed {shall be} the substance of it.
<WEB Isaiah 7.1>  And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, {that} Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up towards Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
<WEB Isaiah 7.2>  And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
<WEB Isaiah 7.3>  Then said the LORD to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
<WEB Isaiah 7.4>  And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
<WEB Isaiah 7.5>  Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 7.6>  Let us go up against Judah, and harass it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, {even} the son of Tabeal.
<WEB Isaiah 7.7>  Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
<WEB Isaiah 7.8>  For the head of Syria {is} Damascus, and the head of Damascus {is} Rezin; and within sixty five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
<WEB Isaiah 7.9>  And the head of Ephraim {is} Samaria, and the head of Samaria {is} Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
<WEB Isaiah 7.10>  Moreover, the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 7.11>  Ask thee a sign from the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the hight above.
<WEB Isaiah 7.12>  But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 7.13>  And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David? {Is it} a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
<WEB Isaiah 7.14>  Therefore the LORD himself will give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
<WEB Isaiah 7.15>  Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
<WEB Isaiah 7.16>  For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken by both her kings.
<WEB Isaiah 7.17>  The LORD will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; {even} the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 7.18>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD will hiss for the fly that {is} in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that {is} in the land of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 7.19>  And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
<WEB Isaiah 7.20>  In the same day will the LORD shave with a razor that is hired, {namely}, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet. and it shall also consume the beard.
<WEB Isaiah 7.21>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
<WEB Isaiah 7.22>  And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk {that} they shall give, he shall eat butter. for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
<WEB Isaiah 7.23>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand pieces of silver, it shall {even} be for briers and thorns.
<WEB Isaiah 7.24>  With arrows and with bows shall {men} come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
<WEB Isaiah 7.25>  And {on} all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns. but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.
<WEB Isaiah 8.1>  Moreover, the LORD said to me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
<WEB Isaiah 8.2>  And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
<WEB Isaiah 8.3>  And I went to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
<WEB Isaiah 8.4>  For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 8.5>  The LORD spoke also to me again, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 8.6>  Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
<WEB Isaiah 8.7>  Now therefore, behold, the LORD bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, {even} the king of Assyria, and all his glory. and he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.
<WEB Isaiah 8.8>  And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach {even} to the neck; and the extension of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
<WEB Isaiah 8.9>  Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries. gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
<WEB Isaiah 8.10>  Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand. for God {is} with us.
<WEB Isaiah 8.11>  For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 8.12>  Say ye not, A confederacy, to all {them to} whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
<WEB Isaiah 8.13>  Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and {let} him {be} your fear, and {let} him {be} your dread.
<WEB Isaiah 8.14>  And he will be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 8.15>  And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be insnared, and be taken.
<WEB Isaiah 8.16>  Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
<WEB Isaiah 8.17>  And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
<WEB Isaiah 8.18>  Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me {are} for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 8.19>  And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter. should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?
<WEB Isaiah 8.20>  To the law and to the testimony. if they speak not according to this word, {it is} because {there is} no light in them.
<WEB Isaiah 8.21>  And they shall pass through it, distressed and hungry. and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.
<WEB Isaiah 8.22>  And they shall look to the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and {they shall be} driven to darkness.
<WEB Isaiah 9.1>  Nevertheless the dimness {shall} not {be} such as {was} in her distress, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict {her by} the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.
<WEB Isaiah 9.2>  The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light. they that dwell in the land of the shades of death, upon them hath the light shined.
<WEB Isaiah 9.3>  Thou hast multiplied the nation, {and} not increased the joy. they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, {and} as {men} rejoice when they divide the spoil.
<WEB Isaiah 9.4>  For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
<WEB Isaiah 9.5>  For every battle of the warrior {is} with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but {this} shall be with burning {and} fuel of fire.
<WEB Isaiah 9.6>  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given. and the government shall be upon his shoulder. and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
<WEB Isaiah 9.7>  Of the increase of {his} government and peace {there shall be} no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.
<WEB Isaiah 9.8>  The LORD sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 9.9>  And all the people shall know, {even} Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,
<WEB Isaiah 9.10>  The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change {them into} cedars.
<WEB Isaiah 9.11>  Therefore the LORD will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;
<WEB Isaiah 9.12>  The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 9.13>  For the people turn not to him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 9.14>  Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.
<WEB Isaiah 9.15>  The ancient and honorable, he {is} the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he {is} the tail.
<WEB Isaiah 9.16>  For the leaders of this people cause {them} to err; and {they that are} led by them {are} destroyed.
<WEB Isaiah 9.17>  Therefore the LORD will have no joy in their young men, neither will have mercy on their fatherless and widows. for every one {is} a hypocrite and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 9.18>  For wickedness burneth as the fire. it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up {like} the rising of smoke.
<WEB Isaiah 9.19>  Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire. no man shall spare his brother.
<WEB Isaiah 9.20>  And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied. they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm.
<WEB Isaiah 9.21>  Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh. {and} they together {shall be} against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 10.1>  Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness {which} they have prescribed;
<WEB Isaiah 10.2>  To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and {that} they may rob the fatherless!
<WEB Isaiah 10.3>  And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation {which} shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
<WEB Isaiah 10.4>  Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand {is} stretched out still.
<WEB Isaiah 10.5>  O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation.
<WEB Isaiah 10.6>  I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
<WEB Isaiah 10.7>  Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but {it is} in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
<WEB Isaiah 10.8>  For he saith, {Are} not my princes altogether kings?
<WEB Isaiah 10.9>  {Is} not Calno as Carchemish? {is} not Hamath as Arpad? {is} not Samaria as Damascus?
<WEB Isaiah 10.10>  As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images excelled them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
<WEB Isaiah 10.11>  Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
<WEB Isaiah 10.12>  Wherefore it shall come to pass, {that} when the LORD hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
<WEB Isaiah 10.13>  For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done {it}, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent. and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant {man}.
<WEB Isaiah 10.14>  And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people. and as one gathereth eggs {that are} left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
<WEB Isaiah 10.15>  Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth with it? {or} shall the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? as if the rod should shake {itself} against them that lift it, {or} as if the staff should lift {itself}, {as if it were} no wood.
<WEB Isaiah 10.16>  Therefore will the LORD, the LORD of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he will kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
<WEB Isaiah 10.17>  And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame. and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
<WEB Isaiah 10.18>  And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.
<WEB Isaiah 10.19>  And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
<WEB Isaiah 10.20>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the remnant of Israel, and such as have escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that smote them; but shall lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
<WEB Isaiah 10.21>  The remnant shall return, {even} the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
<WEB Isaiah 10.22>  For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, {yet} a remnant of them shall return. the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 10.23>  For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.
<WEB Isaiah 10.24>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian. he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 10.25>  For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction.
<WEB Isaiah 10.26>  And the LORD of hosts will raise up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. and {as} his rod {was} upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 10.27>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
<WEB Isaiah 10.28>  He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his furniture.
<WEB Isaiah 10.29>  They have gone over the passage. they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul hath fled.
<WEB Isaiah 10.30>  Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim. cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.
<WEB Isaiah 10.31>  Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
<WEB Isaiah 10.32>  As yet shall he remain at Nob that day. he shall shake his hand {against} the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 10.33>  Behold, the LORD, the LORD of hosts will lop the bough with terror. and the high ones of stature {shall be} hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.
<WEB Isaiah 10.34>  And he shall cut down the thickets of the forests with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
<WEB Isaiah 11.1>  And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
<WEB Isaiah 11.2>  And the spirit of the LORD will rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;
<WEB Isaiah 11.3>  And will make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD. and he will not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears.
<WEB Isaiah 11.4>  But with righteousness will he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. and he will smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips will he slay the wicked.
<WEB Isaiah 11.5>  And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
<WEB Isaiah 11.6>  The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
<WEB Isaiah 11.7>  And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together. and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
<WEB Isaiah 11.8>  And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the den of the basilisk.
<WEB Isaiah 11.9>  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain. for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 11.10>  And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek. and his rest shall be glorious.
<WEB Isaiah 11.11>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the isles of the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 11.12>  And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

<WEB Isaiah 11.16>  And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; as it was to Israel in the day that he came up from the land of Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 12.1>  And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee. though thou wast angry with me, thy anger is turned away, and thou hast comforted me.
<WEB Isaiah 12.2>  Behold, God {is} my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid. for the LORD JEHOVAH {is} my strength and {my} song; he also is become my salvation.

<WEB Isaiah 13.2>  Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice to them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
<WEB Isaiah 13.3>  I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for my anger, {even} them that rejoice in my highness.
<WEB Isaiah 13.4>  The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations assembled. the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

<WEB Isaiah 13.9>  Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate. and he will destroy its sinners out of it.
<WEB Isaiah 13.10>  For the stars of heaven and its constellations shall not give their light. the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
<WEB Isaiah 13.11>  And I will punish the world for {their} evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

<WEB Isaiah 13.19>  And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellence, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
<WEB Isaiah 13.20>  It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
<WEB Isaiah 13.21>  But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

<WEB Isaiah 14.6>  He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, {and} none hindereth.
<WEB Isaiah 14.7>  The whole earth is at rest, {and} is quiet. they break forth into singing.
<WEB Isaiah 14.8>  Yes, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, {and} the cedars of Lebanon, {saying}, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.
<WEB Isaiah 14.9>  Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet {thee} at thy coming. it stirreth up the dead for thee, {even} all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
<WEB Isaiah 14.10>  All they shall speak and say to thee, Art thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like us?
<WEB Isaiah 14.11>  Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, {and} the noise of thy viols. the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.
<WEB Isaiah 14.12>  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! {how} art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
<WEB Isaiah 14.13>  For thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north.
<WEB Isaiah 14.14>  I will ascend above the hights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.
<WEB Isaiah 14.15>  Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
<WEB Isaiah 14.16>  They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, {and} consider thee, {saying}, {Is} this the man that made the earth to tremble, that shook kingdoms.
<WEB Isaiah 14.17>  {That} made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed its cities; {that} opened not the house of his prisoners?
<WEB Isaiah 14.18>  All the kings of the nations, {even} all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.
<WEB Isaiah 14.19>  But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, {and as} the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.
<WEB Isaiah 14.20>  Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, {and} slain thy people. the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned.
<WEB Isaiah 14.21>  Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they may not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
<WEB Isaiah 14.22>  For I will arise against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 14.23>  I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water. and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 14.24>  The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, {so} shall it stand.
<WEB Isaiah 14.25>  That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot. then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.
<WEB Isaiah 14.26>  This {is} the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth. and this {is} the hand that is stretched over all the nations.
<WEB Isaiah 14.27>  For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul {it}? and his hand {is} stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
<WEB Isaiah 14.28>  In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
<WEB Isaiah 14.29>  Rejoice not thou, all Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken. for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk, and his fruit {shall be} a fiery flying serpent.
<WEB Isaiah 14.30>  And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety. and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.
<WEB Isaiah 14.31>  Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, all Palestina, {art} dissolved. for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none {shall be} alone in his appointed times.
<WEB Isaiah 14.32>  What shall {one} then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.
<WEB Isaiah 15.1>  The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, {and} brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, {and} brought to silence;
<WEB Isaiah 15.2>  He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba. on all their heads {shall be} baldness, {and} every beard shorn.
<WEB Isaiah 15.3>  In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth. on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.
<WEB Isaiah 15.4>  And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh. their voice shall be heard {even} to Jahaz. therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous to him.
<WEB Isaiah 15.5>  My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives {shall flee} to Zoar, a heifer of three years old. for they shall go up the ascent of Luhith with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise a cry of destruction.
<WEB Isaiah 15.6>  For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate. for the herb is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.
<WEB Isaiah 15.7>  Therefore the abundance they have gained, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
<WEB Isaiah 15.8>  For the cry hath gone round the borders of Moab, her howling to Eglaim, and her howling to Beer-elim.
<WEB Isaiah 15.9>  For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood. for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 16.1>  Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 16.2>  For it shall be, {that}, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, {so} the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
<WEB Isaiah 16.3>  Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noon-day; hide the outcasts; discover not him that wandereth.
<WEB Isaiah 16.4>  Let my outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler. for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 16.5>  And in mercy shall the throne be established. and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 16.6>  We have heard of the pride of Moab; {he is} very proud. {even} of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath. {but} his lies {shall} not {be} so.
<WEB Isaiah 16.7>  Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl. for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely {they are} stricken.
<WEB Isaiah 16.8>  For the fields of Heshbon languish, {and} the vine of Sibmah. the lords of the heathen have broken down her principal plants, they have come {even} to Jazer, they wandered {through} the wilderness. her branches are extended, they have gone over the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 16.9>  Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah. I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh. for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.
<WEB Isaiah 16.10>  And gladness is taken away, and joy from the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting. the treaders shall tread out no wine in {their} presses; I have made {their vintage} -shouting to cease.
<WEB Isaiah 16.11>  Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-haresh.
<WEB Isaiah 16.12>  And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.
<WEB Isaiah 16.13>  This {is} the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.
<WEB Isaiah 16.14>  But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant {shall be} very small {and} feeble.
<WEB Isaiah 17.1>  The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from {being} a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.
<WEB Isaiah 17.2>  The cities of Aroer {are} forsaken. they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make {them} afraid.
<WEB Isaiah 17.3>  The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria. they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 17.4>  And in that day it shall come to pass, {that} the glory of Jacob shall be diminished, and the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.
<WEB Isaiah 17.5>  And it shall be as when the harvest-man gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
<WEB Isaiah 17.6>  Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive-tree, two {or} three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four {or} five in the outmost fruitful branches of it, saith the LORD God of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 17.7>  At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 17.8>  And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect {that} which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.
<WEB Isaiah 17.9>  In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel. and there shall be desolation.
<WEB Isaiah 17.10>  Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with foreign slips.
<WEB Isaiah 17.11>  In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish. {but} the harvest {shall be} a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
<WEB Isaiah 17.12>  Woe to the multitude of many people, {who} make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, {that} make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!
<WEB Isaiah 17.13>  The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters. but {God} will rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.
<WEB Isaiah 17.14>  And behold at the time of evening trouble; {and} before the morning he {is} not. This {is} the portion of them that ravage us, and the lot of them that rob us.
<WEB Isaiah 18.1>  Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which {is} beyond the rivers of Cush.
<WEB Isaiah 18.2>  That sendeth embassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, {saying}, Go, ye swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation measured by line and trodden down, whose land the rivers have laid waste.
<WEB Isaiah 18.3>  All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.
<WEB Isaiah 18.4>  For so the LORD said to me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling-place like a clear heat upon herbs, {and} like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
<WEB Isaiah 18.5>  For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and take away {and} cut down the branches.
<WEB Isaiah 18.6>  They shall be left together to the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth. and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
<WEB Isaiah 18.7>  In that time shall the present be brought to the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation measured by line and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 19.1>  The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and will come into Egypt. and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.
<WEB Isaiah 19.2>  And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians. and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, {and} kingdom against kingdom.
<WEB Isaiah 19.3>  And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of her, and I will destroy her counsel. and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.
<WEB Isaiah 19.4>  And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 19.5>  And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the rivers shall be wasted and dried up.
<WEB Isaiah 19.6>  And they shall turn the rivers far away; {and} the brooks of defense shall be emptied and dried up. the reeds and flags shall wither.
<WEB Isaiah 19.7>  The paper-reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no {more}.
<WEB Isaiah 19.8>  The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
<WEB Isaiah 19.9>  Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave net-works shall be confounded.
<WEB Isaiah 19.10>  And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices {and} ponds for fish.
<WEB Isaiah 19.11>  Surely the princes of Zoan {are} fools, the counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh is become brutish. how say ye to Pharaoh, I {am} the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
<WEB Isaiah 19.12>  Where {are} they? where {are} thy wise {men}? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 19.13>  The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, {even they that are} the support of its tribes.
<WEB Isaiah 19.14>  The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst of it. and they have caused Egypt to err in every work of it, as a drunken {man} staggereth in his vomit.
<WEB Isaiah 19.15>  Neither shall there be {any} work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may perform.
<WEB Isaiah 19.16>  In that day shall Egypt be like women. and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.
<WEB Isaiah 19.17>  And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt, every one that maketh mention of it shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.
<WEB Isaiah 19.18>  In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.
<WEB Isaiah 19.19>  In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border to the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 19.20>  And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt. for they shall cry to the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a savior, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.
<WEB Isaiah 19.21>  And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yes, they shall vow a vow to the LORD, and perform {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 19.22>  And the LORD will smite Egypt. he will smite and heal {it}. and they shall return {even} to the LORD, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.
<WEB Isaiah 19.23>  In that day shall there be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.
<WEB Isaiah 19.24>  In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, {even} a blessing in the midst of the land.
<WEB Isaiah 19.25>  Whom the LORD of hosts will bless, saying, Blessed {be} Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.
<WEB Isaiah 20.1>  In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;
<WEB Isaiah 20.2>  At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
<WEB Isaiah 20.3>  And the LORD said, As my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years {for} a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Cush;
<WEB Isaiah 20.4>  So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Cushites captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with {their} hind-parts uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
<WEB Isaiah 20.5>  And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Cush their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
<WEB Isaiah 20.6>  And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such {is} our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. and how shall we escape?
<WEB Isaiah 21.1>  The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; {so} it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.
<WEB Isaiah 21.2>  A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler plundereth. Go up, O Elam. besiege, O Media; all her sighing have I made to cease.
<WEB Isaiah 21.3>  Therefore are my loins filled with pain. pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth. I was bowed down at the hearing {of it}; I was dismayed at the seeing {of it}.
<WEB Isaiah 21.4>  My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me. the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear to me.
<WEB Isaiah 21.5>  Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower, eat, drink. arise, ye princes, {and} anoint the shield.
<WEB Isaiah 21.6>  For thus hath the LORD said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.
<WEB Isaiah 21.7>  And he saw a chariot {with} a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, {and} a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed.
<WEB Isaiah 21.8>  And he cried, a lion. My lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day time, and I am set in my ward whole nights.
<WEB Isaiah 21.9>  And behold, here cometh a chariot of men, {with} a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken to the ground.
<WEB Isaiah 21.10>  O my threshing, and the corn of my floor; that which I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared to you.
<WEB Isaiah 21.11>  The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
<WEB Isaiah 21.12>  The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night. if ye will inquire, inquire ye. return, come.
<WEB Isaiah 21.13>  The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye traveling companies of Dedanim.
<WEB Isaiah 21.14>  The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they met with their bread him that fled.
<WEB Isaiah 21.15>  For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
<WEB Isaiah 21.16>  For thus hath the LORD said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail.
<WEB Isaiah 21.17>  And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished. for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 22.1>  The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou hast wholly gone up to the house-tops?
<WEB Isaiah 22.2>  Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city. thy slain {men are} not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.
<WEB Isaiah 22.3>  All thy rulers have fled together, they are bound by the archers. all that are found in thee are bound together, {who} have fled from far.
<WEB Isaiah 22.4>  Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labor not to comfort me, because of the devastation of the daughter of my people.
<WEB Isaiah 22.5>  For {it is} a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.
<WEB Isaiah 22.6>  And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men {and} horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
<WEB Isaiah 22.7>  And it shall come to pass, {that} thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.
<WEB Isaiah 22.8>  And he uncovered the coverings of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armor of the house of the forest.
<WEB Isaiah 22.9>  Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many. and ye collected the waters of the lower pool.
<WEB Isaiah 22.10>  And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.
<WEB Isaiah 22.11>  Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool. but ye have not looked to its maker, neither had respect to him that fashioned it long ago.
<WEB Isaiah 22.12>  And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.
<WEB Isaiah 22.13>  And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine. let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we shall die.
<WEB Isaiah 22.14>  And it was revealed in my ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 22.15>  Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, repair to this treasurer, {even} to Shebna, who {is} over the house, {and say},
<WEB Isaiah 22.16>  What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulcher here, {as} he that heweth him out a sepulcher on high, {and} that graveth a habitation for himself in a rock?
<WEB Isaiah 22.17>  Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee.
<WEB Isaiah 22.18>  With violence he will surely turn and toss thee {like} a ball into a wide country. there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory {shall be} the shame of thy lord's house.
<WEB Isaiah 22.19>  And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.
<WEB Isaiah 22.20>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah.
<WEB Isaiah 22.21>  And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand. and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
<WEB Isaiah 22.22>  And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
<WEB Isaiah 22.23>  And I will fasten him {as} a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.
<WEB Isaiah 22.24>  And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.
<WEB Isaiah 22.25>  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that {was} upon it shall be cut off. for the LORD hath spoken it.
<WEB Isaiah 23.1>  The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.
<WEB Isaiah 23.2>  Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
<WEB Isaiah 23.3>  And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, {is} her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.
<WEB Isaiah 23.4>  Be thou ashamed, O Zidon. for the sea hath spoken, {even} the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish young men, {nor} bring up virgins.
<WEB Isaiah 23.5>  As at the report concerning Egypt, {so} shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.
<WEB Isaiah 23.6>  Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
<WEB Isaiah 23.7>  {Is} this your joyous {city}, whose antiquity {is} of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her far off to sojourn.
<WEB Isaiah 23.8>  Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning {city}, whose merchants {are} princes, whose traders {are} the honorable of the earth?
<WEB Isaiah 23.9>  The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, {and} to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 23.10>  Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish. {there is} no more strength.
<WEB Isaiah 23.11>  He stretched his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms. the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant {city}, to destroy its strong holds.
<WEB Isaiah 23.12>  And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon. arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.
<WEB Isaiah 23.13>  Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, {till} the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness. they set up its towers, they raised up its palaces; {and} he brought it to ruin.
<WEB Isaiah 23.14>  Howl, ye ships of Tarshish. for your strength is laid waste.
<WEB Isaiah 23.15>  And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as a harlot.
<WEB Isaiah 23.16>  Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.
<WEB Isaiah 23.17>  And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 23.18>  And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD. it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, for sufficient food, and for durable clothing.
<WEB Isaiah 24.1>  Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad its inhabitants.
<WEB Isaiah 24.2>  And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him.
<WEB Isaiah 24.3>  The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled. for the LORD hath spoken this word.
<WEB Isaiah 24.4>  The earth mourneth {and} fadeth away, the world languisheth {and} fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.
<WEB Isaiah 24.5>  The earth also is defiled under its inhabitants; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.
<WEB Isaiah 24.6>  Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell in it are desolate. therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
<WEB Isaiah 24.7>  The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merry-hearted do sigh.
<WEB Isaiah 24.8>  The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.
<WEB Isaiah 24.9>  They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.
<WEB Isaiah 24.10>  The city of confusion is broken down. every house is shut up, that no man may enter.
<WEB Isaiah 24.11>  {There} is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.
<WEB Isaiah 24.12>  In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
<WEB Isaiah 24.13>  When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, {there shall be} as the shaking of an olive-tree, {and} as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.
<WEB Isaiah 24.14>  They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 24.15>  Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, {even} the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 24.16>  From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, {even} glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe to me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yes, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.
<WEB Isaiah 24.17>  Fear, and the pit, and the snare, {are} upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 24.18>  And it shall come to pass, {that} he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare. for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
<WEB Isaiah 24.19>  The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is entirely dissolved, the earth is exceedingly moved.
<WEB Isaiah 24.20>  The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression of it shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
<WEB Isaiah 24.21>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones {that are} on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 24.22>  And they shall be gathered, {as} prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.
<WEB Isaiah 24.23>  Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.
<WEB Isaiah 25.1>  O LORD, thou {art} my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful {things}; {thy} counsels of old {are} faithfulness {and} truth.
<WEB Isaiah 25.2>  For thou hast made of a city a heap; {of} a fortified city a ruin. a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
<WEB Isaiah 25.3>  Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
<WEB Isaiah 25.4>  For thou hast been a defense to the poor, a defense to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones {is} as a storm {against} the wall.
<WEB Isaiah 25.5>  Thou wilt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; {even} the heat with the shade of a cloud. the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
<WEB Isaiah 25.6>  And on this mountain will the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
<WEB Isaiah 25.7>  And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail {that is} spread over all nations.
<WEB Isaiah 25.8>  He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people will he remove from all the earth. for the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 25.9>  And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this {is} our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us. this is the LORD, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
<WEB Isaiah 25.10>  For on this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
<WEB Isaiah 25.11>  And he will spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth {his hands} to swim. and he will bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.
<WEB Isaiah 25.12>  And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls will he bring down, lay low, {and} bring to the ground, {even} to the dust.
<WEB Isaiah 26.1>  In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will {God} appoint {for} walls and bulwarks.
<WEB Isaiah 26.2>  Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
<WEB Isaiah 26.3>  Thou wilt keep {him} in perfect peace, {whose} mind {is} stayed {on thee}. because he trusteth in thee.
<WEB Isaiah 26.4>  Trust ye in the LORD for ever. for in the LORD JEHOVAH {is} everlasting strength.
<WEB Isaiah 26.5>  For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, {even} to the ground; he bringeth it {even} to the dust.
<WEB Isaiah 26.6>  The foot shall tread it down, {even} the feet of the poor, {and} the steps of the needy.
<WEB Isaiah 26.7>  The way of the just {is} uprightness. thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
<WEB Isaiah 26.8>  Yes, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of {our} soul {is} to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
<WEB Isaiah 26.9>  With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yes, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early. for when thy judgments {are} in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 26.10>  Let favor be shown to the wicked, {yet} he will not learn righteousness. in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 26.11>  LORD, {when} thy hand is lifted up, they will not see. {but} they shall see, and be ashamed for {their} envy at the people; yes, the fire of thy enemies shall devour them.
<WEB Isaiah 26.12>  LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us. for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
<WEB Isaiah 26.13>  O LORD our God, {other} lords beside thee have had dominion over us; {but} by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
<WEB Isaiah 26.14>  {They are} dead, they shall not live; {they are} deceased, they shall not rise. therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
<WEB Isaiah 26.15>  Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified. thou hadst removed {it} far to all the ends of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 26.16>  LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer {when} thy chastening {was} upon them.
<WEB Isaiah 26.17>  As a woman with child, {that} draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, {and} crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 26.18>  We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance on the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
<WEB Isaiah 26.19>  Thy dead {men} shall live, {together with} my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust. for thy dew {is as} the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
<WEB Isaiah 26.20>  Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation shall be overpast.
<WEB Isaiah 26.21>  For behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
<WEB Isaiah 27.1>  In that day the LORD with his keen and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he will slay the dragon that {is} in the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 27.2>  In that day sing ye to her, A vineyard of red wine.
<WEB Isaiah 27.3>  I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment. lest {any} hurt it, I will keep it night and day.
<WEB Isaiah 27.4>  Fury {is} not in me. who would set the briers {and} thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.
<WEB Isaiah 27.5>  Or let him take hold of my strength, {that} he may make peace with me, {and} he shall make peace with me.
<WEB Isaiah 27.6>  He shall cause them that descend from Jacob to take root. Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.
<WEB Isaiah 27.7>  Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? {or} is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?
<WEB Isaiah 27.8>  In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it. he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.
<WEB Isaiah 27.9>  By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this {is} all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalk-stones that are beaten asunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.
<WEB Isaiah 27.10>  Yet the fortified city {shall be} desolate, {and} the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness. there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume its branches.
<WEB Isaiah 27.11>  When its boughs are withered, they shall be broken off. the women come {and} set them on fire. for it {is} a people of no understanding. therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no favor.
<WEB Isaiah 27.12>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD shall gather from the channel of the river to the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 27.13>  And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD on the holy mount at Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 28.1>  Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty {is} a fading flower; who {are} on the head of the rich valleys of them that are overcome with wine!
<WEB Isaiah 28.2>  Behold, the LORD hath a mighty and strong one, {which} as a tempest of hail {and} a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.
<WEB Isaiah 28.3>  The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet.
<WEB Isaiah 28.4>  And the glorious beauty, which {is} on the head of the rich valley, shall be a fading flower, {and} as the early fruit before the summer; which, {when} he that looketh upon it, seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
<WEB Isaiah 28.5>  In that day will the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people,
<WEB Isaiah 28.6>  And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
<WEB Isaiah 28.7>  But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are overwhelmed with wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble {in} judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 28.8>  For all tables are full of vomit {and} filthiness, {so that there is} no place {clean}.
<WEB Isaiah 28.9>  Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? {them that are} weaned from the milk, {and} drawn from the breasts.
<WEB Isaiah 28.10>  For precept {must be} upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, {and} there a little.
<WEB Isaiah 28.11>  For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
<WEB Isaiah 28.12>  To whom he said, This {is} the rest {with which} ye may cause the weary to rest; and this {is} the refreshing. yet they would not hear.
<WEB Isaiah 28.13>  But the word of the LORD was to them, precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, {and} there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
<WEB Isaiah 28.14>  Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which {is} in Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 28.15>  Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we in agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not reach us. for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.
<WEB Isaiah 28.16>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner {stone}, a sure foundation. he that believeth shall not make haste.
<WEB Isaiah 28.17>  Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet. and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.
<WEB Isaiah 28.18>  And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
<WEB Isaiah 28.19>  From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you. for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night. and it shall be a vexation only {to} understand the report.
<WEB Isaiah 28.20>  For the bed is shorter than that {a man} can stretch himself {on it}. and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself {in it}.
<WEB Isaiah 28.21>  For the LORD will rise as {on} mount Perazim, he will be wroth as {in} the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
<WEB Isaiah 28.22>  Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong. for I have heard from the LORD God of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
<WEB Isaiah 28.23>  Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
<WEB Isaiah 28.24>  Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?
<WEB Isaiah 28.25>  When he hath made even the face of it, doth he not cast abroad the vetches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat, and the appointed barley, and the rye in their place?
<WEB Isaiah 28.26>  For his God doth instruct him to discretion, {and} doth teach him.
<WEB Isaiah 28.27>  For the vetches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the vetches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
<WEB Isaiah 28.28>  Bread -{corn} is bruised; because he will not always be threshing it, nor break {it with} the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it {with} his horsemen.
<WEB Isaiah 28.29>  This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, {who} is wonderful in counsel, {and} excellent in operation.
<WEB Isaiah 29.1>  Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city {where} David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.
<WEB Isaiah 29.2>  Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow; and it shall be to me as Ariel.
<WEB Isaiah 29.3>  And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.
<WEB Isaiah 29.4>  And thou shalt be brought down, {and} shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
<WEB Isaiah 29.5>  Moreover, the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones {shall be} as chaff that passeth away. yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.
<WEB Isaiah 29.6>  Thou shalt be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.
<WEB Isaiah 29.7>  And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night-vision.
<WEB Isaiah 29.8>  It shall even be as when a hungry {man} dreameth, and behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty. or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and behold, {he is} faint, and his soul hath appetite. so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 29.9>  Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry. they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
<WEB Isaiah 29.10>  For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes. the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.
<WEB Isaiah 29.11>  And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which {men} deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. and he saith, I cannot; for it {is} sealed.
<WEB Isaiah 29.12>  And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. and he saith, I am not learned.
<WEB Isaiah 29.13>  Wherefore the LORD said, Forasmuch as this people draw near {me} with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men.
<WEB Isaiah 29.14>  Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, {even} an astonishing work and a wonder. for the wisdom of their wise {men} shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent {men} shall be hid.
<WEB Isaiah 29.15>  Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
<WEB Isaiah 29.16>  Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay. for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
<WEB Isaiah 29.17>  {Is} it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
<WEB Isaiah 29.18>  And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
<WEB Isaiah 29.19>  The meek also shall increase {their} joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 29.20>  For the terrible one is brought to naught, and the scoffer is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off.
<WEB Isaiah 29.21>  That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught.
<WEB Isaiah 29.22>  Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now become pale.
<WEB Isaiah 29.23>  But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 29.24>  They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
<WEB Isaiah 30.1>  Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not from me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin.
<WEB Isaiah 30.2>  That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shade of Egypt!
<WEB Isaiah 30.3>  Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shade of Egypt {your} confusion.
<WEB Isaiah 30.4>  For his princes were at Zoan, and his embassadors came to Hanes.
<WEB Isaiah 30.5>  They were all ashamed of a people {that} could not profit them, nor be a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
<WEB Isaiah 30.6>  The burden of the beasts of the south. into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence {come} the young and the old lion, the viper and flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people {that} shall not profit {them}.
<WEB Isaiah 30.7>  For the Egyptian shall help in vain, and to no purpose. therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength {is} to sit still.
<WEB Isaiah 30.8>  Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.
<WEB Isaiah 30.9>  That this {is} a rebellious people, lying children, children {that} will not hear the law of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 30.10>  Who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits.
<WEB Isaiah 30.11>  Withdraw from the way, turn aside from the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
<WEB Isaiah 30.12>  Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and lean upon it.
<WEB Isaiah 30.13>  Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
<WEB Isaiah 30.14>  And he shall break it as the breaking of the potter's vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare. so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a piece to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the pit.
<WEB Isaiah 30.15>  For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. and ye would not.
<WEB Isaiah 30.16>  But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee. and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
<WEB Isaiah 30.17>  One thousand {shall flee} at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee. till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.
<WEB Isaiah 30.18>  And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious to you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you. for the LORD {is} a God of judgment. blessed {are} all they that wait for him.
<WEB Isaiah 30.19>  For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. thou shalt weep no more. he will be very gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
<WEB Isaiah 30.20>  And {though} the LORD shall give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thy eyes shall see thy teachers.
<WEB Isaiah 30.21>  And thy ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This {is} the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
<WEB Isaiah 30.22>  Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold. thou shalt cast them away as a polluted cloth; thou shalt say to it, Be gone from me.
<WEB Isaiah 30.23>  Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, with which thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous. in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
<WEB Isaiah 30.24>  The oxen likewise and the young asses that plow the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
<WEB Isaiah 30.25>  And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers {and} streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
<WEB Isaiah 30.26>  Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
<WEB Isaiah 30.27>  Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning {with} his anger, and the burden {of it is} heavy. his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire.
<WEB Isaiah 30.28>  And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity. and {there shall be} a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing {them} to err.
<WEB Isaiah 30.29>  Ye shall have a song, as in the night, {when} a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come upon the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 30.30>  And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of {his} anger, and {with} the flame of a devouring fire, {with} scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
<WEB Isaiah 30.31>  For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, {who} smote with a rod.
<WEB Isaiah 30.32>  And {in} every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, {it} shall be with tabrets and harps. and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.
<WEB Isaiah 30.33>  For Tophet {is} ordained of old; yes, for the king it is prepared; he hath made {it} deep {and} large. the pile of it {is} fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
<WEB Isaiah 31.1>  Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and rely on horses, and trust in chariots, because {they are} many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!
<WEB Isaiah 31.2>  Yet he also {is} wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words. but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
<WEB Isaiah 31.3>  Now the Egyptians {are} men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.
<WEB Isaiah 31.4>  For thus hath the LORD spoken to me, As the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, {he} will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them. so will the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.
<WEB Isaiah 31.5>  As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver {it}; {and} passing over he will preserve {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 31.6>  Turn ye to {him from} whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.
<WEB Isaiah 31.7>  For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you {for} a sin.
<WEB Isaiah 31.8>  Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him. but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.
<WEB Isaiah 31.9>  And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire {is} in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 32.1>  Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 32.2>  And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land.
<WEB Isaiah 32.3>  And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
<WEB Isaiah 32.4>  The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
<WEB Isaiah 32.5>  The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said {to be} bountiful.
<WEB Isaiah 32.6>  For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry; and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
<WEB Isaiah 32.7>  The instruments also of the churl {are} evil. he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.
<WEB Isaiah 32.8>  But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.
<WEB Isaiah 32.9>  Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear to my speech.
<WEB Isaiah 32.10>  Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women. for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.
<WEB Isaiah 32.11>  Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones. strip ye, and make you bare, and gird {sackcloth} upon {your} loins.
<WEB Isaiah 32.12>  They shall lament for the breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
<WEB Isaiah 32.13>  Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns {and} briers; also, upon all the houses of joy {in} the joyous city.
<WEB Isaiah 32.14>  Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
<WEB Isaiah 32.15>  Until the spirit shall be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness shall be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be counted for a forest.
<WEB Isaiah 32.16>  Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
<WEB Isaiah 32.17>  And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.
<WEB Isaiah 32.18>  And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places;
<WEB Isaiah 32.19>  When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.
<WEB Isaiah 32.20>  Blessed {are} ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth {thither} the feet of the ox and the ass.
<WEB Isaiah 33.1>  Woe to thee that layest waste, and thou {wast} not laid waste; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to lay waste, thou shalt be wasted; {and} when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
<WEB Isaiah 33.2>  O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for thee. be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
<WEB Isaiah 33.3>  At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.
<WEB Isaiah 33.4>  And your spoil shall be gathered {like} the gathering of the caterpillar. as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.
<WEB Isaiah 33.5>  The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high. he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 33.6>  And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, {and} strength of salvation. the fear of the LORD {is} his treasure.
<WEB Isaiah 33.7>  Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without. the embassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.
<WEB Isaiah 33.8>  The highways lie waste, the way-faring man ceaseth. he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.
<WEB Isaiah 33.9>  The earth mourneth {and} languisheth. Lebanon is ashamed {and} hewn down. Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off {their fruits}.
<WEB Isaiah 33.10>  Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.
<WEB Isaiah 33.11>  Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble. your breath, {as} fire, shall devour you.
<WEB Isaiah 33.12>  And the people shall be {as} the burnings of lime. {as} thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.
<WEB Isaiah 33.13>  Ye {that are} far off, hear what I have done; and ye {that are} near, acknowledge my might.
<WEB Isaiah 33.14>  The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
<WEB Isaiah 33.15>  He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;
<WEB Isaiah 33.16>  He shall dwell on high. his place of defense {shall be} the munitions of rocks. bread shall be given him; his waters {shall be} sure.
<WEB Isaiah 33.17>  Thy eyes shall see the king in his beauty. they shall behold the land that is very far off.
<WEB Isaiah 33.18>  Thy heart shall meditate terror. Where {is} the scribe? where {is} the receiver? where {is} he that counted the towers?
<WEB Isaiah 33.19>  Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, {that thou canst} not understand.
<WEB Isaiah 33.20>  Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities. thy eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle {that} shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, neither shall any of its cords be broken.
<WEB Isaiah 33.21>  But there the glorious LORD {will be} to us a place of broad rivers {and} streams; in which shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass through it.
<WEB Isaiah 33.22>  For the LORD {is} our judge, the LORD {is} our lawgiver, the LORD {is} our king; he will save us.
<WEB Isaiah 33.23>  Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail. then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.
<WEB Isaiah 33.24>  And the inhabitants shall not say, I am sick. the people that dwell therein {shall be} forgiven {their} iniquity.
<WEB Isaiah 34.1>  Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people. let the earth hear, and all that is in it; the world, and all things that spring from it.
<WEB Isaiah 34.2>  For the indignation of the LORD {is} upon all nations, and {his} fury upon all their armies. he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
<WEB Isaiah 34.3>  Their slain also shall be cast out, and their ill smell shall come up from their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
<WEB Isaiah 34.4>  And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll. and all their hosts shall fall down, as the leaf falleth from the vine, and as a falling {fig} from the fig-tree.
<WEB Isaiah 34.5>  For my sword shall be bathed in heaven. behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 34.6>  The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, {and} with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
<WEB Isaiah 34.7>  And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be drenched with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
<WEB Isaiah 34.8>  For {it is} the day of the LORD'S vengeance, {and} the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 34.9>  And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch.
<WEB Isaiah 34.10>  It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke of it shall ascend for ever. from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
<WEB Isaiah 34.11>  But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it. and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
<WEB Isaiah 34.12>  They shall call her nobles to the kingdom, but none {shall be} there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
<WEB Isaiah 34.13>  And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in her fortresses, and it shall be a habitation of dragons, {and} a court for owls.
<WEB Isaiah 34.14>  The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the isle, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech-owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
<WEB Isaiah 34.15>  There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow. there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
<WEB Isaiah 34.16>  Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read. no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate. for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.
<WEB Isaiah 34.17>  And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it to them by line. they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
<WEB Isaiah 35.1>  The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.
<WEB Isaiah 35.2>  It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice, even with joy and singing. the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellence of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, {and} the excellence of our God.
<WEB Isaiah 35.3>  Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
<WEB Isaiah 35.4>  Say to them {that are} of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not. behold, your God will come {with} vengeance, {even} God {with} a recompense; he will come and save you.
<WEB Isaiah 35.5>  Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
<WEB Isaiah 35.6>  Then shall the lame {man} leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing. for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
<WEB Isaiah 35.7>  And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water. in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, {shall be} grass with reeds and rushes.
<WEB Isaiah 35.8>  And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it {shall be} for those. the way-faring men, though fools, shall not err {therein}.
<WEB Isaiah 35.9>  No lion shall be there, nor {any} ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk {there}.
<WEB Isaiah 35.10>  And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads. they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
<WEB Isaiah 36.1>  Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, {that} Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
<WEB Isaiah 36.2>  And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem against king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
<WEB Isaiah 36.3>  Then came forth to him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
<WEB Isaiah 36.4>  And Rabshakeh said to them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence {is} this in which thou trustest?
<WEB Isaiah 36.5>  I say, {sayest thou} (but {they are but} vain words) {I have} counsel and strength for war. now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
<WEB Isaiah 36.6>  Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which if a man lean, it will enter his hand, and pierce it. so {is} Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
<WEB Isaiah 36.7>  But if thou shalt say to me, We trust in the LORD our God. {is it} not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
<WEB Isaiah 36.8>  Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou canst on thy part set riders upon them.
<WEB Isaiah 36.9>  How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
<WEB Isaiah 36.10>  And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
<WEB Isaiah 36.11>  Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand {it}. and speak not to us in the Jew's language, in the ears of the people that {are} on the wall.
<WEB Isaiah 36.12>  But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? {hath he} not {sent me} to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may devour their vilest excretions with you?
<WEB Isaiah 36.13>  Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jew's language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 36.14>  Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you. for he will not be able to deliver you.
<WEB Isaiah 36.15>  Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, the LORD will surely deliver us. this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 36.16>  Hearken not to Hezekiah. for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make {an agreement} with me {by} a present, and come out to me. and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
<WEB Isaiah 36.17>  Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
<WEB Isaiah 36.18>  {Beware} lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
<WEB Isaiah 36.19>  Where {are} the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where {are} the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
<WEB Isaiah 36.20>  Who {are they} among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
<WEB Isaiah 36.21>  But they held their peace, and answered him not a word. for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
<WEB Isaiah 36.22>  Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with {their} clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
<WEB Isaiah 37.1>  And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard {it}, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 37.2>  And he sent Eliakim, who {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
<WEB Isaiah 37.3>  And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day {is} a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy. for the children are come to the birth, and {there is} not strength to bring forth.
<WEB Isaiah 37.4>  It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard. wherefore lift up {thy} prayer for the remnant that is left.
<WEB Isaiah 37.5>  So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
<WEB Isaiah 37.6>  And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
<WEB Isaiah 37.7>  Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
<WEB Isaiah 37.8>  So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah. for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
<WEB Isaiah 37.9>  And he heard it said concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard {it}, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 37.10>  Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 37.11>  Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
<WEB Isaiah 37.12>  Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, {as} Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who {were} in Telassar?
<WEB Isaiah 37.13>  Where {is} the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
<WEB Isaiah 37.14>  And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 37.15>  And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 37.16>  O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest {between} the cherubim, thou {art} the God, {even} thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. thou hast made heaven and earth.
<WEB Isaiah 37.17>  Incline thy ear, O LORD, and hear; open thy eyes, O LORD, and see. and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God.
<WEB Isaiah 37.18>  Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
<WEB Isaiah 37.19>  And have cast their gods into the fire. for they {were} no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone. therefore they have destroyed them.
<WEB Isaiah 37.20>  Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou {art} the LORD, {even} thou only.
<WEB Isaiah 37.21>  Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria.
<WEB Isaiah 37.22>  This {is} the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, {and} derided thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
<WEB Isaiah 37.23>  Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed; and against whom hast thou exalted {thy} voice, and lifted thy eyes on high? {even} against the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 37.24>  By thy servants hast thou reproached the LORD, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots have I come up to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, {and} its choice fir-trees. and I will enter into the hight of its border, {and} the forest of its Carmel.
<WEB Isaiah 37.25>  I have digged, and drank water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
<WEB Isaiah 37.26>  Hast thou not heard long ago, {how} I have done it; {and} of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities {into} ruinous heaps.
<WEB Isaiah 37.27>  Therefore their inhabitants {were} of small power, they were dismayed and confounded. they were {as} the grass of the field, and {as} the green herb, {as} the grass on the house-tops, and {as corn} blasted before it is grown up.
<WEB Isaiah 37.28>  But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
<WEB Isaiah 37.29>  Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
<WEB Isaiah 37.30>  And this {shall be} a sign to thee, Ye shall eat {this} year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same. and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
<WEB Isaiah 37.31>  And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
<WEB Isaiah 37.32>  For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion. the zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
<WEB Isaiah 37.33>  Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a mound against it.
<WEB Isaiah 37.34>  By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 37.35>  For I will defend this city, to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
<WEB Isaiah 37.36>  Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand. and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they {were} all dead corpses.
<WEB Isaiah 37.37>  So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
<WEB Isaiah 37.38>  And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia. and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
<WEB Isaiah 38.1>  In those days was Hezekiah sick with a mortal disease. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order. for thou shalt die, and not live.
<WEB Isaiah 38.2>  Then Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall, and prayed to the LORD,
<WEB Isaiah 38.3>  And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done {that which is} good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
<WEB Isaiah 38.4>  Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
<WEB Isaiah 38.5>  Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears. behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.
<WEB Isaiah 38.6>  And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. and I will defend this city.
<WEB Isaiah 38.7>  And this {shall be} a sign to thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;
<WEB Isaiah 38.8>  Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which hath gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it had gone down.
<WEB Isaiah 38.9>  The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered from his sickness.
<WEB Isaiah 38.10>  I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave. I am deprived of the residue of my years.
<WEB Isaiah 38.11>  I said, I shall not see the LORD, {even} the LORD, in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
<WEB Isaiah 38.12>  My age hath departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent. I have cut off like a weaver my life. he will cut me off with pining sickness. from day {even} to night wilt thou make an end of me.
<WEB Isaiah 38.13>  I reckoned till morning, {that}, as a lion, so will he break all my bones. from day {even} to night wilt thou make an end of me.
<WEB Isaiah 38.14>  Like a crane {or} a swallow, so I chattered. I mourned as a dove. my eyes fail {with looking} upward. O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
<WEB Isaiah 38.15>  What shall I say? he hath both spoken to me, and himself hath done {it}. I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
<WEB Isaiah 38.16>  O LORD, by these {things men} live, and in all these {things is} the life of my spirit. so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
<WEB Isaiah 38.17>  Behold, for peace I had great bitterness. but thou hast in love to my soul {delivered it} from the pit of corruption. for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
<WEB Isaiah 38.18>  For the grave cannot praise thee, death can {not} celebrate thee. they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
<WEB Isaiah 38.19>  The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I {do} this day. the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
<WEB Isaiah 38.20>  The LORD {was ready} to save me. therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 38.21>  For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay {it} for a plaster upon the boil, and he will recover.
<WEB Isaiah 38.22>  Hezekiah also had said, What {is} the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?
<WEB Isaiah 39.1>  At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah. for he had heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.
<WEB Isaiah 39.2>  And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them.
<WEB Isaiah 39.3>  Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? and Hezekiah said, They have come to me from a far country, {even} from Babylon.
<WEB Isaiah 39.4>  Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that {is} in my house have they seen. there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
<WEB Isaiah 39.5>  Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts.
<WEB Isaiah 39.6>  Behold, the days come, that all that {is} in thy house, and {that} which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon. nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 39.7>  And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
<WEB Isaiah 39.8>  Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good {is} the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.
<WEB Isaiah 40.1>  Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
<WEB Isaiah 40.2>  Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned. for she hath received from the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.
<WEB Isaiah 40.3>  The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
<WEB Isaiah 40.4>  Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low. and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.
<WEB Isaiah 40.5>  And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh together shall see {it}. for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 40.6>  The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh {is} grass, and all its goodliness {is} as the flower of the field.
<WEB Isaiah 40.7>  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth. because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it. surely the people {is} grass.
<WEB Isaiah 40.8>  The grass withereth, the flower fadeth. but the word of our God shall shall stand forever.
<WEB Isaiah 40.9>  O Zion, that bringest good tidings, go up upon the high mountain. O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift {it} up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
<WEB Isaiah 40.10>  Behold, the LORD GOD will come with strong {hand}, and his arm will rule for him. behold, his reward {is} with him, and his work before him.
<WEB Isaiah 40.11>  He will feed his flock like a shepherd. he will gather the lambs with his arm, and carry {them} in his bosom, {and} will gently lead those that are with young.
<WEB Isaiah 40.12>  Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
<WEB Isaiah 40.13>  Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or {being} his counselor hath taught him?
<WEB Isaiah 40.14>  With whom took he counsel, and {who} instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?
<WEB Isaiah 40.15>  Behold, the nations {are} as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance. behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
<WEB Isaiah 40.16>  And Lebanon {is} not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts of it sufficient for a burnt-offering.
<WEB Isaiah 40.17>  All nations before him {are} as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
<WEB Isaiah 40.18>  To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare to him?
<WEB Isaiah 40.19>  The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
<WEB Isaiah 40.20>  He that {is} so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree {that} will not rot; he seeketh for himself a skillful workman to prepare a graven image {that} shall not be moved.
<WEB Isaiah 40.21>  Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
<WEB Isaiah 40.22>  {It is} he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants {are} as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.
<WEB Isaiah 40.23>  That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
<WEB Isaiah 40.24>  Yes, they shall not be planted; yes, they shall not be sown. yes, their stock shall not take root in the earth. and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
<WEB Isaiah 40.25>  To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equaled? saith the Holy One.
<WEB Isaiah 40.26>  Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these {things}, that bringeth out their host by number. he calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might, for that {he} is strong in power; not one faileth.
<WEB Isaiah 40.27>  Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over by my God?
<WEB Isaiah 40.28>  Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, {that} the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? {there is} no searching of his understanding.
<WEB Isaiah 40.29>  He giveth power to the faint; and to {them that have} no might he increaseth strength.
<WEB Isaiah 40.30>  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.
<WEB Isaiah 40.31>  But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew {their} strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.
<WEB Isaiah 41.1>  Keep silence before me, O isles; and let the people renew {their} strength. let them come near; then let them speak. let us come near together to judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 41.2>  Who raised up the righteous {man} from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made {him} rule over kings? he gave {them} as the dust to his sword, {and} as driven stubble to his bow.
<WEB Isaiah 41.3>  He pursued them, {and} passed safely; {even} by the way {that} he had not gone with his feet.
<WEB Isaiah 41.4>  Who hath wrought and done {it}, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I {am} he.
<WEB Isaiah 41.5>  The isles saw {it}, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.
<WEB Isaiah 41.6>  They helped every one his neighbor; and {every one} said to his brother, Be of good courage.
<WEB Isaiah 41.7>  So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, {and} he that smootheth {with} the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It {is} ready for the sodering. and he fastened it with nails, {that} it should not be moved.
<WEB Isaiah 41.8>  But thou, Israel, {art} my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.
<WEB Isaiah 41.9>  {Thou} whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said to thee, Thou {art} my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

<WEB Isaiah 41.11>  Behold, all {they that were} incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded. they shall be as nothing; and they that contend with thee shall perish.
<WEB Isaiah 41.12>  Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, {even} them that contended with thee. they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of naught.
<WEB Isaiah 41.13>  For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying to thee, Fear not; I will help thee.
<WEB Isaiah 41.14>  Fear not, thou worm Jacob, {and} ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 41.15>  Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth. thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat {them} small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.
<WEB Isaiah 41.16>  Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them. and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, {and} shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 41.17>  {When} the poor and needy seek water, and {there is} none, {and} their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, {I} the God of Israel will not forsake them.
<WEB Isaiah 41.18>  I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys. I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
<WEB Isaiah 41.19>  I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah-tree, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together.
<WEB Isaiah 41.20>  That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.
<WEB Isaiah 41.21>  Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong {reasons}, saith the King of Jacob.
<WEB Isaiah 41.22>  Let them bring {them} forth, and show us what shall happen. let them show the former things, what they {are} that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare to us things to come.
<WEB Isaiah 41.23>  Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye {are} gods. yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold {it} together.
<WEB Isaiah 41.24>  Behold, ye {are} of nothing, and your work of naught. an abomination {is he that} chooseth you.
<WEB Isaiah 41.25>  I have raised up {one} from the north, and he shall come. from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name. and he shall come upon princes as {upon} mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.
<WEB Isaiah 41.26>  Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and before time, that we may say, {He is} righteous? verily, {there is} none that showeth, verily, {there is} none that declareth, verily, {there is} none that heareth your words.
<WEB Isaiah 41.27>  The first {shall say} to Zion, Behold, behold them. and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.
<WEB Isaiah 41.28>  For I beheld, and {there was} no man; even among them, and {there was} no counselor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.
<WEB Isaiah 41.29>  Behold, they {are} all vanity, their works {are} nothing. their molten images {are} wind and confusion.
<WEB Isaiah 42.1>  Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, {in whom} my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him. he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
<WEB Isaiah 42.2>  He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
<WEB Isaiah 42.3>  A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench. he shall bring forth judgment to truth.
<WEB Isaiah 42.4>  He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he hath set judgment in the earth. and the isles shall wait for his law.
<WEB Isaiah 42.5>  Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and expanded them; he that spread forth the earth, and that which it produceth; he that giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein.
<WEB Isaiah 42.6>  I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;
<WEB Isaiah 42.7>  To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, {and} them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.
<WEB Isaiah 42.8>  I {am} the LORD. that {is} my name. and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
<WEB Isaiah 42.9>  Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things do I declare. before they spring forth I tell you of them.
<WEB Isaiah 42.10>  Sing to the LORD a new song, {and} his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is in it; the isles, and their inhabitants.
<WEB Isaiah 42.11>  Let the wilderness and its cities lift up {their voice}, the villages {that} Kedar doth inhabit. let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
<WEB Isaiah 42.12>  Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the isles.
<WEB Isaiah 42.13>  The LORD will go forth as a mighty man, he will stir up jealousy like a man of war. he will cry, yes, roar; he will prevail against his enemies.
<WEB Isaiah 42.14>  I have long time held my peace; I have been still, {and} restrained myself. {now} will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.
<WEB Isaiah 42.15>  I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers {to be} islands, and I will dry up the pools.
<WEB Isaiah 42.16>  And I will bring the blind by a way {that} they knew not; I will lead them in paths {that} they have not known. I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do for them, and not forsake them.
<WEB Isaiah 42.17>  They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye {are} our gods.
<WEB Isaiah 42.18>  Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
<WEB Isaiah 42.19>  Who {is} blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger {that} I sent? who {is} blind as {he that is} perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant?

<WEB Isaiah 42.21>  The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make {it} honorable.
<WEB Isaiah 42.22>  But this {is} a people robbed and pillaged; {they are} all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses; they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.
<WEB Isaiah 42.23>  Who among you will give ear to this? {who} will hearken, and hear for the time to come?
<WEB Isaiah 42.24>  Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law.
<WEB Isaiah 42.25>  Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle. and it hath set him on fire around, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid {it} not to heart.
<WEB Isaiah 43.1>  But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not. for I have redeemed thee, I have called {thee} by thy name; thou {art} mine.
<WEB Isaiah 43.2>  When thou passest through the waters, I {will be} with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee. when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
<WEB Isaiah 43.3>  For I {am} the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior. I gave Egypt {for} thy ransom, Cush and Seba for thee.
<WEB Isaiah 43.4>  Since thou hast been precious in my sight, thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee. therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.
<WEB Isaiah 43.5>  Fear not. for I {am} with thee. I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
<WEB Isaiah 43.6>  I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back. bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
<WEB Isaiah 43.7>  {Even} every one that is called by my name. for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; verily, I have made him.
<WEB Isaiah 43.8>  Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
<WEB Isaiah 43.9>  Let all the nations be collected, and let the people be assembled. who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified. or let them hear, and say, {It is} truth.
<WEB Isaiah 43.10>  Ye {are} my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen. that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I {am} he. before me there was no god formed, neither shall there be after me.
<WEB Isaiah 43.11>  I, {even} I, {am} the LORD; and besides me {there is} no savior.
<WEB Isaiah 43.12>  I have declared, and have saved, and I have shown, when {there was} no strange {god} among you. therefore ye {are} my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I {am} God.
<WEB Isaiah 43.13>  Yes, before the day {was}, I {am} he; and {there is} none that can deliver out of my hand. I will work, and who shall hinder it?
<WEB Isaiah 43.14>  Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry {is} in the ships.
<WEB Isaiah 43.15>  I {am} the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
<WEB Isaiah 43.16>  Thus saith the LORD, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
<WEB Isaiah 43.17>  Who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise. they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
<WEB Isaiah 43.18>  Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
<WEB Isaiah 43.19>  Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, {and} rivers in the desert.
<WEB Isaiah 43.20>  The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls. because I give waters in the wilderness, {and} rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
<WEB Isaiah 43.21>  This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.
<WEB Isaiah 43.22>  But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 43.23>  Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
<WEB Isaiah 43.24>  Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices. but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thy iniquities.
<WEB Isaiah 43.25>  I, {even} I, {am} he that blotteth out thy transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
<WEB Isaiah 43.26>  Put me in remembrance. let us plead together. declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
<WEB Isaiah 43.27>  Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
<WEB Isaiah 43.28>  Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
<WEB Isaiah 44.1>  Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen.
<WEB Isaiah 44.2>  Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, {who} will help thee. Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
<WEB Isaiah 44.3>  For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground. I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy offspring.
<WEB Isaiah 44.4>  And they shall spring up {as} among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
<WEB Isaiah 44.5>  One shall say, I {am} the LORD'S; and another shall call {himself} by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe {with} his hand to the LORD, and surname {himself} by the name of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 44.6>  Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I {am} the first, and I {am} the last; and besides me {there is} no God.
<WEB Isaiah 44.7>  And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them show to them.
<WEB Isaiah 44.8>  Fear ye not, neither be afraid. have not I told thee from that time, and have declared {it}? ye {are} even my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? verily {there is} no God; I know not {any}.
<WEB Isaiah 44.9>  They that make a graven image {are} all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they {are} their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
<WEB Isaiah 44.10>  Who hath formed a god, or cast a graven image {that} is profitable for nothing?
<WEB Isaiah 44.11>  Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed. and the workmen, they {are} of men. let them all be assembled, let them stand up; {yet} they shall fear, {and} they shall be ashamed together.
<WEB Isaiah 44.12>  The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms. yes, he is hungry, and his strength faileth. he drinketh no water, and is faint.
<WEB Isaiah 44.13>  The carpenter stretcheth out {his} rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.
<WEB Isaiah 44.14>  He heweth down cedars for himself, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest. he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 44.15>  Then shall it be for a man to burn. for he will take of it, and warm himself; indeed he kindleth {it}, and baketh bread; yes, he maketh a god, and worshipeth {it}; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down to it.
<WEB Isaiah 44.16>  He burneth part of it in the fire; with part of it he eateth flesh; he roasteth meat, and is satisfied. yes, he warmeth {himself}, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.

<WEB Isaiah 44.19>  And none considereth in his heart, neither {is there} knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; I have also baked bread upon its coals; I have roasted flesh, and eaten {it}. and shall I make the residue of it an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
<WEB Isaiah 44.20>  He feedeth on ashes. a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, {Is there} not a lie in my right hand?
<WEB Isaiah 44.21>  Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou {art} my servant. I have formed thee; thou {art} my servant. O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten by me.
<WEB Isaiah 44.22>  I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and as a cloud, thy sins. return to me; for I have redeemed thee.
<WEB Isaiah 44.23>  Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done {it}. shout, ye lower parts of the earth. break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein. for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 44.24>  Thus saith the LORD thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, {I am} the LORD that maketh all {things}; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.
<WEB Isaiah 44.25>  That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise {men} backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
<WEB Isaiah 44.26>  That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up her decayed places.
<WEB Isaiah 44.27>  That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers.
<WEB Isaiah 44.28>  That saith of Cyrus, {He is} my shepherd, and {he} shall perform all my pleasure. even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
<WEB Isaiah 45.1>  Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates shall not be shut;
<WEB Isaiah 45.2>  I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight. I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut asunder the bars of iron.
<WEB Isaiah 45.3>  And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, who call {thee} by thy name, {am} the God of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 45.4>  For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name. I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
<WEB Isaiah 45.5>  I {am} the LORD, and {there is} none else, {there is} no God besides me. I girded thee, though thou hast not known me.
<WEB Isaiah 45.6>  That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that {there is} none besides me. I {am} the LORD, and {there is} none else.
<WEB Isaiah 45.7>  I form the light, and create darkness. I make peace, and create evil. I the LORD do all these {things}.

<WEB Isaiah 45.9>  Woe to him that contendeth with his Maker! {Let} the potsherd {contend} with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?

<WEB Isaiah 45.14>  Thus saith the LORD, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to thee, and they shall be thine. they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to thee, they shall make supplication to thee, {saying}, Surely God {is} in thee; and {there is} none else, {there is} no God.
<WEB Isaiah 45.15>  Verily thou {art} a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
<WEB Isaiah 45.16>  They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them. they shall go to confusion together {that are} makers of idols.
<WEB Isaiah 45.17>  {But} Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation. ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.
<WEB Isaiah 45.18>  For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited. I {am} the LORD; and {there is} none else.
<WEB Isaiah 45.19>  I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I have not said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
<WEB Isaiah 45.20>  Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye {that have} escaped of the nations. they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god {that} cannot save.
<WEB Isaiah 45.21>  Tell ye, and bring {them} near; yes, let them take counsel together. who hath declared this from ancient time? {who} hath told it from that time? {have} not I the LORD? and {there is} no God else besides me; a just God and a Savior; {there is} none besides me.
<WEB Isaiah 45.22>  Look to me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth. for I {am} God, and {there is} none else.

<WEB Isaiah 46.1>  Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle. your loads {were} heavy; {they were} a burden to the weary {beast}.
<WEB Isaiah 46.2>  They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves have gone into captivity.
<WEB Isaiah 46.3>  Hearken to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne {by me} from the birth, which are carried from the womb.
<WEB Isaiah 46.4>  And {even} to {your} old age I {am} he; and {even} to hoary hairs will I carry {you}. I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver {you}.
<WEB Isaiah 46.5>  To whom will ye liken me, and make {me} equal, and compare me, that we may be like?

<WEB Isaiah 46.10>  Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times {the things} that are not {yet} done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.
<WEB Isaiah 46.11>  Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country. yes, I have spoken {it}, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed {it}, I will also perform it.
<WEB Isaiah 46.12>  Hearken to me, ye stout-hearted, that {are} far from righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 46.13>  I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay. and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
<WEB Isaiah 47.1>  Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground. {there is} no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans. for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.
<WEB Isaiah 47.2>  Take the millstones, and grind meal. uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.
<WEB Isaiah 47.3>  Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, thy shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance, and I will not meet {thee as} a man.
<WEB Isaiah 47.4>  {As for} our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts {is} his name, the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 47.5>  Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans. for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.
<WEB Isaiah 47.6>  I was wroth with my people, I have polluted my inheritance, and given them into thy hand. thou didst show them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
<WEB Isaiah 47.7>  And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever. {so} that thou didst not lay these {things} to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.
<WEB Isaiah 47.8>  Therefore hear now this, {thou that art} given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thy heart, I {am}, and none else besides me; I shall not sit {as} a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children.
<WEB Isaiah 47.9>  But these two {things} shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood. they shall come upon thee in their perfection, for the multitude of thy sorceries, {and} for the great abundance of thy enchantments.
<WEB Isaiah 47.10>  For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness. thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thy heart, I {am}, and none else besides me.
<WEB Isaiah 47.11>  Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth. and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off. and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, {which} thou shalt not know.
<WEB Isaiah 47.12>  Stand now with thy enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast labored from thy youth; if thou shalt be able to profit, if thou mayest prevail.
<WEB Isaiah 47.13>  Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from {these things} that shall come upon thee.
<WEB Isaiah 47.14>  Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame. {there shall} not {be} a coal to warm at, {nor} fire to sit before it.
<WEB Isaiah 47.15>  Thus shall they be to thee with whom thou hast labored, {even} thy merchants, from thy youth. they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
<WEB Isaiah 48.1>  Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, {but} not in truth, nor in righteousness.
<WEB Isaiah 48.2>  For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts {is} his name.
<WEB Isaiah 48.3>  I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth from my mouth, and I showed them; I did {them} suddenly, and they came to pass.
<WEB Isaiah 48.4>  Because I knew that thou {art} obstinate, and thy neck {is} an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
<WEB Isaiah 48.5>  I have even from the beginning declared {it} to thee; before it came to pass I showed {it} thee. lest thou shouldst say, My idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.
<WEB Isaiah 48.6>  Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare {it}? I have showed ye new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.
<WEB Isaiah 48.7>  They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardst them not; lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew them.
<WEB Isaiah 48.8>  Yes, thou heardst not; yes, thou knewest not; yes, from that time {that} thy ear was not opened. for I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.
<WEB Isaiah 48.9>  For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.
<WEB Isaiah 48.10>  Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
<WEB Isaiah 48.11>  For my own sake, {even} for my own sake, will I do {it}. for how should {my name} be profaned? and I will not give my glory to another.
<WEB Isaiah 48.12>  Hearken to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I {am} he; I {am} the first, I also {am} the last.
<WEB Isaiah 48.13>  My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens. {when} I call to them, they stand up together.
<WEB Isaiah 48.14>  All ye, assemble yourselves and hear; who among them hath declared these {things}? The LORD hath loved him. he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm {shall be on} the Chaldeans.
<WEB Isaiah 48.15>  I, {even} I, have spoken, yes, I have called him. I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
<WEB Isaiah 48.16>  Come ye near to me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there {am} I. and now the LORD God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.
<WEB Isaiah 48.17>  Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I {am} the LORD thy God, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way {that} thou shouldst go.
<WEB Isaiah 48.18>  O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.
<WEB Isaiah 48.19>  Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like its gravel; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
<WEB Isaiah 48.20>  Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it {even} to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.
<WEB Isaiah 48.21>  And they thirsted not, {when} he led them through the deserts. he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them. he cleaved the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
<WEB Isaiah 48.22>  {There is} no peace, saith the LORD, to the wicked.
<WEB Isaiah 49.1>  Listen to me, O Isles; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.
<WEB Isaiah 49.2>  And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shade of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;
<WEB Isaiah 49.3>  And said to me, Thou {art} my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
<WEB Isaiah 49.4>  Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for naught, and in vain; {yet} surely my judgment {is} with the LORD, and my work with my God.
<WEB Isaiah 49.5>  And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb {to be} his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.
<WEB Isaiah 49.6>  And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 49.7>  Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, {and} his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, {and} the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.
<WEB Isaiah 49.8>  Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee. and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages.
<WEB Isaiah 49.9>  That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that {are} in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures {shall be} in all high places.
<WEB Isaiah 49.10>  They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them. for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
<WEB Isaiah 49.11>  And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
<WEB Isaiah 49.12>  Behold, these shall come from far. and lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
<WEB Isaiah 49.13>  Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains. for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
<WEB Isaiah 49.14>  But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my LORD hath forgotten me.

<WEB Isaiah 49.16>  Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of {my} hands; thy walls {are} continually before me.
<WEB Isaiah 49.17>  Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste, shall go forth from thee.
<WEB Isaiah 49.18>  Lift up thy eyes around, and behold. all these assemble themselves, {and} come to thee. {As} I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them {on thee}, as a bride {doeth}.
<WEB Isaiah 49.19>  For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
<WEB Isaiah 49.20>  The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thy ears, The place {is} too narrow for me. give place to me that I may dwell.
<WEB Isaiah 49.21>  Then shalt thou say in thy heart, Who hath begotten these for me, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where {have} they {been}?
<WEB Isaiah 49.22>  Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people. and they shall bring thy sons in {their} arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon {their} shoulders.

<WEB Isaiah 49.25>  But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered. for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
<WEB Isaiah 49.26>  And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine. and all flesh shall know that I the LORD {am} thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
<WEB Isaiah 50.1>  Thus saith the LORD, Where {is} the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors {is it} to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
<WEB Isaiah 50.2>  Why, when I came, {was there} no man? when I called, {was there} none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness. their fish becometh putrid, because {there is} no water, and dieth for thirst.
<WEB Isaiah 50.3>  I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
<WEB Isaiah 50.4>  The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to {him that is} weary. he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth my ear to hear as the learned.
<WEB Isaiah 50.5>  The LORD GOD opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.
<WEB Isaiah 50.6>  I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
<WEB Isaiah 50.7>  For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded. therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
<WEB Isaiah 50.8>  {He is} near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together; who {is} my adversary? let him come near to me.
<WEB Isaiah 50.9>  Behold the Lord GOD will help me; who {is} he {that} shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.
<WEB Isaiah 50.10>  Who {is} among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh {in} darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and rely upon his God.
<WEB Isaiah 50.11>  Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that encompass {yourselves} with sparks. walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks {that} ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
<WEB Isaiah 51.1>  Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD. look to the rock {whence} ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit {whence} ye are digged.
<WEB Isaiah 51.2>  Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah {that} bore you. for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.
<WEB Isaiah 51.3>  For the LORD will comfort Zion. he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
<WEB Isaiah 51.4>  Hearken to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation. for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.
<WEB Isaiah 51.5>  My righteousness {is} near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on my arm shall they trust.
<WEB Isaiah 51.6>  Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath. for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall become old like a garment, and its inhabitants shall die in like manner. but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
<WEB Isaiah 51.7>  Hearken to me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart {is} my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
<WEB Isaiah 51.8>  For the moth shall eat them like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool. but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
<WEB Isaiah 51.9>  Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. {Art} thou not that which hath cut Rahab, {and} wounded the dragon?
<WEB Isaiah 51.10>  {Art} thou not that which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?
<WEB Isaiah 51.11>  Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy {shall be} upon their head. they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
<WEB Isaiah 51.12>  I, {even} I, {am} he that comforteth you. who {art} thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man {that} shall die, and of the son of man {who} shall be made {as} grass;
<WEB Isaiah 51.13>  And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where {is} the fury of the oppressor?
<WEB Isaiah 51.14>  The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
<WEB Isaiah 51.15>  But I {am} the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared. The LORD of hosts {is} his name.
<WEB Isaiah 51.16>  And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shade of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, Thou {art} my people.
<WEB Isaiah 51.17>  Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drank at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drank the dregs of the cup of trembling, {and} wrung {them} out.
<WEB Isaiah 51.18>  {There is} none to guide her among all the sons {whom} she hath brought forth; neither {is there any} that taketh her by the hand of all the sons {that} she hath brought up.
<WEB Isaiah 51.19>  These two {things} have come to thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword. by whom shall I comfort thee?
<WEB Isaiah 51.20>  Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net. they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.
<WEB Isaiah 51.21>  Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine.
<WEB Isaiah 51.22>  Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God {that} pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling, {even} the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again.
<WEB Isaiah 51.23>  But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul, Prostrate thyself, that we may go over. and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
<WEB Isaiah 52.1>  Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
<WEB Isaiah 52.2>  Shake thyself from the dust; arise, {and} sit down, O Jerusalem. loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 52.3>  For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for naught; and ye shall be redeemed without money.
<WEB Isaiah 52.4>  For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down formerly into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
<WEB Isaiah 52.5>  Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for naught? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day {is} blasphemed.
<WEB Isaiah 52.6>  Therefore my people shall know my name. therefore {they shall know} in that day that I {am} he that doth speak. behold, {it is} I.
<WEB Isaiah 52.7>  How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith to Zion, Thy God reigneth!
<WEB Isaiah 52.8>  Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing. for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.
<WEB Isaiah 52.9>  Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem. for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 52.10>  The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations. and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
<WEB Isaiah 52.11>  Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean {thing}; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.

<WEB Isaiah 52.13>  Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
<WEB Isaiah 52.14>  As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.
<WEB Isaiah 52.15>  So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him. for {that} which had not been told them shall they see; and {that} which they had not heard shall they consider.
<WEB Isaiah 53.1>  Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
<WEB Isaiah 53.2>  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground. he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, {there is} no beauty that we should desire him.
<WEB Isaiah 53.3>  He is despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. and we hid as it were {our} faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
<WEB Isaiah 53.4>  Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
<WEB Isaiah 53.5>  But he {was} wounded for our transgression, {he was} bruised for our iniquities. the chastisement of our peace {was} upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
<WEB Isaiah 53.6>  All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
<WEB Isaiah 53.7>  He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.
<WEB Isaiah 53.8>  He was taken from prison and from judgment. and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off from the land of the living. for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
<WEB Isaiah 53.9>  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death. because he had done no violence, neither {was any} deceit in his mouth.
<WEB Isaiah 53.10>  Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put {him} to grief. when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see {his} seed, he shall prolong {his} days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
<WEB Isaiah 53.11>  He shall see of the travail of his soul, {and} shall be satisfied. by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
<WEB Isaiah 53.12>  Therefore I will divide to him {a portion} with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul to death. and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
<WEB Isaiah 54.1>  Sing, O barren, thou {that} didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou {that} didst not travail with child. for more {are} the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 54.2>  Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them extend the curtains of thy habitations. spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;
<WEB Isaiah 54.3>  For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
<WEB Isaiah 54.4>  Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed. neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame; for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
<WEB Isaiah 54.5>  For thy maker {is} thy husband; the LORD of hosts {is} his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.
<WEB Isaiah 54.6>  For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.
<WEB Isaiah 54.7>  For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.
<WEB Isaiah 54.8>  In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.
<WEB Isaiah 54.9>  For this {is as} the waters of Noah to me. for {as} I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more overflow the earth; so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.
<WEB Isaiah 54.10>  For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.
<WEB Isaiah 54.11>  Oh thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, {and} not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
<WEB Isaiah 54.12>  And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.
<WEB Isaiah 54.13>  And all thy children {shall be} taught from the LORD; and great {shall be} the peace of thy children.
<WEB Isaiah 54.14>  In righteousness shalt thou be established. thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear. and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.
<WEB Isaiah 54.15>  Behold, they shall surely assemble {but} not by me. whoever shall assemble against thee shall fall for thy sake.
<WEB Isaiah 54.16>  Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
<WEB Isaiah 54.17>  No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue {that} shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This {is} the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness {is} from me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 55.1>  Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
<WEB Isaiah 55.2>  Why do ye spend money for {that which is} not bread? and your labor for {that which} satisfieth not? hearken diligently to me, and eat ye {that which is} good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
<WEB Isaiah 55.3>  Incline your ear, and come to me. hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, {even} the sure mercies of David.
<WEB Isaiah 55.4>  Behold, I have given him {for} a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.
<WEB Isaiah 55.5>  Behold, thou shalt call a nation {that} thou knowest not, and nations {that} knew not thee shall run to thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee.
<WEB Isaiah 55.6>  Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.
<WEB Isaiah 55.7>  Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts. and let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
<WEB Isaiah 55.8>  For my thoughts {are} not your thoughts, neither {are} your ways my ways, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 55.9>  For {as} the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
<WEB Isaiah 55.10>  For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater.
<WEB Isaiah 55.11>  So shall my word be that proceedeth from my mouth. it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper {in the thing} for which I sent it.
<WEB Isaiah 55.12>  For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace. the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap {their} hands.
<WEB Isaiah 55.13>  Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle-tree. and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign {that} shall not be cut off.
<WEB Isaiah 56.1>  Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice. for my salvation {is} near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
<WEB Isaiah 56.2>  Blessed {is} the man {that} doeth this, and the son of man {that} layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
<WEB Isaiah 56.3>  Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people. neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I {am} a dry tree.
<WEB Isaiah 56.4>  For thus saith the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose {the things} that please me, and take hold of my covenant;
<WEB Isaiah 56.5>  Even to them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters. I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
<WEB Isaiah 56.6>  Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and taketh hold of my covenant;
<WEB Isaiah 56.7>  Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer. their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices {shall be} accepted upon my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.
<WEB Isaiah 56.8>  The Lord GOD who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, Yet will I gather {others} to him, besides those that are gathered to him.
<WEB Isaiah 56.9>  All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yes, all ye beasts in the forest.
<WEB Isaiah 56.10>  His watchmen {are} blind. they are all ignorant, they {are} all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.
<WEB Isaiah 56.11>  Yes, {they are} greedy dogs {which} can never have enough, and they {are} shepherds {that} cannot understand. they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.
<WEB Isaiah 56.12>  Come ye, {say they}, I will bring wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, {and} much more abundant.
<WEB Isaiah 57.1>  The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth {it} to heart. and merciful men {are} taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil {to come}.
<WEB Isaiah 57.2>  He shall enter into peace. they shall rest in their beds, {each one} walking {in} his uprightness.
<WEB Isaiah 57.3>  But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the lewd.
<WEB Isaiah 57.4>  Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, {and} thrust out the tongue? {are} ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,
<WEB Isaiah 57.5>  Inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the cliffs of the rocks?
<WEB Isaiah 57.6>  Among the smooth {stones} of the stream {is} thy portion; they, they {are} thy lot. even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered a meat-offering. Should I receive comfort in these?
<WEB Isaiah 57.7>  Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed. even thither thou wentest up to offer sacrifice.
<WEB Isaiah 57.8>  Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance. for thou hast uncovered {thyself to another} than me, and hast gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee {a covenant} with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 57.9>  And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase {thyself even} to hell.
<WEB Isaiah 57.10>  Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; {yet} saidst thou not, There is no hope. thou hast found the life of thy hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.
<WEB Isaiah 57.11>  And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid {it} to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?
<WEB Isaiah 57.12>  I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.
<WEB Isaiah 57.13>  When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take {them}. but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;
<WEB Isaiah 57.14>  And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.
<WEB Isaiah 57.15>  For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name {is} Holy; I dwell in the high and holy {place}, with him also {that is} of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
<WEB Isaiah 57.16>  For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth. for the spirit would fail before me, and the souls {which} I have made.
<WEB Isaiah 57.17>  For the iniquity of his covetousness I was wroth, and smote him. I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.
<WEB Isaiah 57.18>  I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
<WEB Isaiah 57.19>  I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to {him that is} far off, and to {him that is} near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.
<WEB Isaiah 57.20>  But the wicked {are} like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
<WEB Isaiah 57.21>  {There is} no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
<WEB Isaiah 58.1>  Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.
<WEB Isaiah 58.2>  Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God. they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.
<WEB Isaiah 58.3>  Why have we fasted, {say they}, and thou seest not? {why} have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labors.
<WEB Isaiah 58.4>  Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. ye shall not fast as {ye do this} day, to make your voice to be heard on high.
<WEB Isaiah 58.5>  Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? {is it} to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes {under him}? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?
<WEB Isaiah 58.6>  {Is} not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
<WEB Isaiah 58.7>  {Is it} not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou shouldst bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou shouldst cover him; and that thou shouldst not hide thyself from thy own flesh?
<WEB Isaiah 58.8>  Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily. and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rear-ward.
<WEB Isaiah 58.9>  Then shalt thou call, and the LORD will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I {am}. If thou shalt take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;
<WEB Isaiah 58.10>  And {if} thou shalt draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness {be} as the noon day.
<WEB Isaiah 58.11>  And the LORD will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drouth, and make fat thy bones. and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
<WEB Isaiah 58.12>  And {they that shall be} of thee shall build the old waste places. thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
<WEB Isaiah 58.13>  If thou shalt turn away thy foot from the sabbath, {from} doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thy own ways, nor finding thy own pleasure, nor speaking {thy own} words.
<WEB Isaiah 58.14>  Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father. for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken {it}.
<WEB Isaiah 59.1>  Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.
<WEB Isaiah 59.2>  But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid {his} face from you, that he will not hear.
<WEB Isaiah 59.3>  For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath uttered perverseness.
<WEB Isaiah 59.4>  None calleth for justice, nor {any} pleadeth for truth. they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
<WEB Isaiah 59.5>  They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the spider's web. he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
<WEB Isaiah 59.6>  Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works. their works {are} works of iniquity, and the act of violence {is} in their hands.
<WEB Isaiah 59.7>  Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. their thoughts {are} thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction {are} in their paths.
<WEB Isaiah 59.8>  The way of peace they know not; and {there is} no judgment in their goings. they have made them crooked paths. whoever goeth therein shall not know peace.
<WEB Isaiah 59.9>  Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us. we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, {but} we walk in darkness.
<WEB Isaiah 59.10>  We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if {we had} no eyes. we stumble at noon day as in the night; {we are} in desolate places as dead {men}.
<WEB Isaiah 59.11>  We all roar like bears, and mourn bitterly like doves. we look for judgment, but {there is} none; for salvation, {but} it is far from us.
<WEB Isaiah 59.12>  For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us. for our transgressions {are} with us; and {as for} our iniquities, we know them;
<WEB Isaiah 59.13>  In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
<WEB Isaiah 59.14>  And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off. for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
<WEB Isaiah 59.15>  Yes, truth faileth; and he {that} departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. and the LORD saw {it}, and it displeased him that {there was} no judgment.
<WEB Isaiah 59.16>  And he saw that {there was} no man, and wondered that {there was} no intercessor. therefore his arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
<WEB Isaiah 59.17>  For he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance {for} clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.
<WEB Isaiah 59.18>  According to {their} deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the isles he will repay recompense.
<WEB Isaiah 59.19>  So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him.
<WEB Isaiah 59.20>  And the Redeemer will come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 59.21>  As for me, this {is} my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that {is} upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.
<WEB Isaiah 60.1>  Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.2>  For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people. but the LORD will arise upon thee, and his glory will be seen upon thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.3>  And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
<WEB Isaiah 60.4>  Lift up thy eyes around, and see. all they assemble themselves, they come to thee. thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at {thy} side.
<WEB Isaiah 60.5>  Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thy heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted to thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come to thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.6>  The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come. they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 60.7>  All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to thee. they shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.
<WEB Isaiah 60.8>  Who {are} these {that} fly as a cloud, and as doves to their windows?
<WEB Isaiah 60.9>  Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.10>  And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister to thee. for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.
<WEB Isaiah 60.11>  Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that {men} may bring to thee the forces of the Gentiles, and {that} their kings {may be} brought.
<WEB Isaiah 60.12>  For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yes, {those} nations shall be utterly wasted.
<WEB Isaiah 60.13>  The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
<WEB Isaiah 60.14>  The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending to thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
<WEB Isaiah 60.15>  Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through {thee}, I will make thee an eternal excellence, a joy of many generations.
<WEB Isaiah 60.16>  Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings. and thou shalt know that I the LORD {am} thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.

<WEB Isaiah 60.20>  Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself. for the LORD will be thy everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
<WEB Isaiah 60.21>  Thy people also {shall be} all righteous. they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
<WEB Isaiah 60.22>  A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation. I the LORD will hasten it in its time.
<WEB Isaiah 61.1>  The Spirit of the Lord GOD {is} upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to publish good tidings to the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to {them that are} bound;
<WEB Isaiah 61.2>  To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
<WEB Isaiah 61.3>  To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.
<WEB Isaiah 61.4>  And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.

<WEB Isaiah 61.10>  I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh {himself} with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth {herself} with her jewels.
<WEB Isaiah 61.11>  For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

<WEB Isaiah 62.2>  And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory. and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.
<WEB Isaiah 62.3>  Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
<WEB Isaiah 62.4>  Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate. but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah. for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
<WEB Isaiah 62.5>  For {as} a young man marrieth a virgin, {so} shall thy sons marry thee. and {as} the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, {so} will thy God rejoice over thee.

<WEB Isaiah 62.8>  The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn {to be} food for thy enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast labored.
<WEB Isaiah 62.9>  But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have collected it shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
<WEB Isaiah 62.10>  Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.
<WEB Isaiah 62.11>  Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed to the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; Behold, his reward {is} with him, and his work before him.
<WEB Isaiah 62.12>  And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD. and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
<WEB Isaiah 63.1>  Who {is} this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this {that is} glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
<WEB Isaiah 63.2>  Why {art thou} red in thy apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat.
<WEB Isaiah 63.3>  I have trodden the wine-press alone; and of the people {there was} none with me. for I will tread them in my anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.
<WEB Isaiah 63.4>  For the day of vengeance {is} in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
<WEB Isaiah 63.5>  And I looked, and {there was} none to help; and I wondered that {there was} none to uphold. therefore my own arm brought salvation to me; and my fury, it upheld me.
<WEB Isaiah 63.6>  And I will tread down the people in my anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
<WEB Isaiah 63.7>  I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the LORD, {and} the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.
<WEB Isaiah 63.8>  For he said, Surely they {are} my people, children {that} will not lie. so he was their Savior.
<WEB Isaiah 63.9>  In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them. in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
<WEB Isaiah 63.10>  But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit. therefore he was turned to be their enemy, {and} he fought against them.
<WEB Isaiah 63.11>  Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, {and} his people, {saying}, Where {is} he that brought them out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where {is} he that put his holy Spirit within him?
<WEB Isaiah 63.12>  That led {them} by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
<WEB Isaiah 63.13>  That led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, {that} they should not stumble?
<WEB Isaiah 63.14>  As a beast goeth down in the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest. so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
<WEB Isaiah 63.15>  Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory. where {is} thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies towards me? are they restrained?
<WEB Isaiah 63.16>  Doubtless thou {art} our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not. thou, O LORD, {art} our father, our Redeemer; thy name {is} from everlasting.
<WEB Isaiah 63.17>  O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, {and} hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thy inheritance.
<WEB Isaiah 63.18>  The people of thy holiness have possessed {it} but a little while. our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
<WEB Isaiah 63.19>  We are {thine}. thou never didst bear rule over them; they were not called by thy name.
<WEB Isaiah 64.1>  Oh that thou wouldst rend the heavens, that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
<WEB Isaiah 64.2>  {As when} the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thy adversaries, {that} the nations may tremble at thy presence!
<WEB Isaiah 64.3>  When thou didst terrible things {which} we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
<WEB Isaiah 64.4>  For since the beginning of the world {men} have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, besides thee, {what} he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
<WEB Isaiah 64.5>  Thou meetest him that rejoiceth, and worketh righteousness, {those that} remember thee in thy ways. behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned. in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.
<WEB Isaiah 64.6>  But we are all as an unclean {thing}, and all our righteousnesses {are} as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
<WEB Isaiah 64.7>  And {there is} none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee. for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.
<WEB Isaiah 64.8>  But now, O LORD, thou {art} our father; we {are} the clay, and thou our potter; and we all {are} the work of thy hand.
<WEB Isaiah 64.9>  Be not very wroth, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever. behold, see, we beseech thee, we {are} all thy people.
<WEB Isaiah 64.10>  Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
<WEB Isaiah 64.11>  Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire. and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
<WEB Isaiah 64.12>  Wilt thou refrain thyself for these {things}, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and grievously afflict us?
<WEB Isaiah 65.1>  I am sought by {them that} asked not {for me}; I am found by {them that} sought me not. I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation {that} was not called by my name.
<WEB Isaiah 65.2>  I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, which walketh in a way {that is} not good, after their own thoughts;
<WEB Isaiah 65.3>  A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
<WEB Isaiah 65.4>  Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable {things is in} their vessels;
<WEB Isaiah 65.5>  Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These {are} a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
<WEB Isaiah 65.6>  Behold, {it is} written before me. I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
<WEB Isaiah 65.7>  Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills. therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
<WEB Isaiah 65.8>  Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and {one} saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing {is} in it. so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.
<WEB Isaiah 65.9>  And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
<WEB Isaiah 65.10>  And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
<WEB Isaiah 65.11>  But ye {are} they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink-offering to that number.
<WEB Isaiah 65.12>  Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter. because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear; but did evil before my eyes, and did choose {that} in which I delighted not.
<WEB Isaiah 65.13>  Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry. behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty. behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed.
<WEB Isaiah 65.14>  Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
<WEB Isaiah 65.15>  And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen. for the Lord GOD will slay thee, and call his servants by another name.
<WEB Isaiah 65.16>  That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.
<WEB Isaiah 65.17>  For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
<WEB Isaiah 65.18>  But be ye glad and rejoice for ever {in that} which I create. for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
<WEB Isaiah 65.19>  And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people. and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
<WEB Isaiah 65.20>  There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days. for the child shall die a hundred years old. but the sinner {being} a hundred years old shall be accursed.
<WEB Isaiah 65.21>  And they shall build houses, and inhabit {them}; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
<WEB Isaiah 65.22>  They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat. for as the days of a tree {are} the days of my people, and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
<WEB Isaiah 65.23>  They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they {are} the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
<WEB Isaiah 65.24>  And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
<WEB Isaiah 65.25>  The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock. and dust {shall be} the serpents' food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.1>  Thus saith the LORD, The heaven {is} my throne, and the earth {is} my footstool. where {is} the house that ye build to me? and where {is} the place of my rest?
<WEB Isaiah 66.2>  For all these {things} hath my hand made, and all these {things} have been, saith the LORD. but to this man {will} I look, {even} to {him that is} poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
<WEB Isaiah 66.3>  He that killeth an ox {is as if} he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, {as if} he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, {as if he offered} swine's blood; he that burneth incense, {as if} he blessed an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
<WEB Isaiah 66.4>  I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear. but they did evil before my eyes, and chose {that} in which I delighted not.
<WEB Isaiah 66.5>  Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified. but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
<WEB Isaiah 66.6>  A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompense to his enemies.
<WEB Isaiah 66.7>  Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a male child.
<WEB Isaiah 66.8>  Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? {or} shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
<WEB Isaiah 66.9>  Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD. shall I cause to bring forth, and shut {the womb}? saith thy God.
<WEB Isaiah 66.10>  Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her. rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her.
<WEB Isaiah 66.11>  That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may draw milk, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
<WEB Isaiah 66.12>  For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream. then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon {her} sides, and be dandled upon {her} knees.
<WEB Isaiah 66.13>  As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
<WEB Isaiah 66.14>  And when ye see {this}, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb. and the hand of the LORD shall be known towards his servants, and {his} indignation towards his enemies.
<WEB Isaiah 66.15>  For behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
<WEB Isaiah 66.16>  For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh. and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
<WEB Isaiah 66.17>  They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one {tree} in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.18>  For I {know} their works and their thoughts. it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
<WEB Isaiah 66.19>  And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them to the nations, {to} Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, {to} Tubal, and Javan, {to} the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
<WEB Isaiah 66.20>  And they shall bring all your brethren {for} an offering to the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.21>  And I will also take of them for priests {and} for Levites, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.22>  For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
<WEB Isaiah 66.23>  And it shall come to pass, {that} from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
<WEB Isaiah 66.24>  And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me. for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.
